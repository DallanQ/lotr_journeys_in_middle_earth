## FIRST CAMPAIGN SETUP (page 4)

To set up their first campaign of *Journeys* in *Middle-earth*, players follow the steps presented in this section.

1. **Select Campaign and Difficulty:** Select the "New Game" button on the app's title screen. Then, the app will guide the players through a series of screens for selecting a campaign, a difficulty, and a save slot. It is recommended that players select the "Bones of Arnor" campaign and "Normal" difficulty.

2. **Create Party and Select Heroes:** Each player selects a hero in the app, takes their hero's corresponding figure and hero card, and places them in their play area. These heroes will be used for the duration of the campaign, which spans several adventures.

If playing single-player, the player chooses two heroes and controls both of them.

> Image of 2 cards (Beravor's starting items), a hero figure and a hero card displaying stats of hero for your choice

3. **Gather Starting Items:** The app assigns starting items for each hero. Each player finds the item cards that match the name and tier displayed in the app and places them near their hero card. Players may select different starting items in the app if they wish.

> Image displays a staff item card with a 1 in the lower right corner indicating Tier 1 on item Card

4. **Create Damage, Fear, and Weakness Decks:** Shuffle the damage cards, fear cards, and weakness skill cards (only weakness skill cards, not other skill cards) into separate decks and place them in the center of the play area where all players can reach them.

> Images showing 3 Decks of cards which represent Damage, Fear, and Weakness cards respectively.

5. **Create Supply:** Separate the exploration/inspiration, search/ threat, person, and enemy banner tokens as well as the three types of boon cards into separate piles to create the supply. Set aside all map tiles and enemy figures; some of them will be used during the adventure. Return the battle map tiles and terrain tokens to the box—they are not used in the first adventure.

> Images showcasing 6 tokens in supply which represent exploration/inspiration, search/threat, person and enemy banner tokens respectively.

> Image showing 3 types of boon cards

6. **Begin Campaign:** The players input a group name, and then select "Begin" in the app and watch the short cutscene that introduces the story and the heroes' quest.

7. **Choose Roles:** Each player selects a role in the app, this is the role their hero takes for the first adventure. A player can choose any role from the menu, but the recommended starting role for each hero is as follows:

- **Aragon:** Captain

- **Beravor:** Pathfinder

- **Bilbo:** Burglar

- **Elena:** Musician

- **Gimli:** Guardian

- **Legolas:** Hunter

### ROLES (page 4)

A hero's role during an adventure determines some of that hero's capabilities. Each role has a general purpose:

- **Burglar:** Evades enemies and is self-sufficient
  
- **Captain:** Helps the party prepare for any situation

- **Guardian:** Protects others and has strong defenses

- **Hunter:** Attacks for heavy damage

- **Musician:** Inspires others to succeed at their tasks

- **Pathfinder:** Helps the party move quickly.

Role selection is not permanent, heroes can change roles between adventures

8. **Gather Skill Cards:** Each hero gathers the following 15 cards:

- one copy of each skill card numbered 1-6 that has the word "Basic" on the bottom of the card

- the skill cards numbered 1-5 that have the name of their hero on the bottom of the card

- the skill cards numbered 1-3 that have their role on the bottom of the card(the text boxes on these cards are colored green to help players quickly identify them)

- one weakness card from the top of the weakness deck

> Image of 6 Basic cards with a role on the bottom of each card ranging from Basic 1-6 respectively

> Image of 5 Beravor cards with a role on the bottom of each card ranging from Beravor 1-5

> Image of a random weakness card

> Image of 3 pathfinder cards with a role on the bottom of each card ranging from 1-3

*If Beravor chooses the Pathfinder role, her skill deck consists of basic 1-6, Beravor 1-5, Pathfinder 1-3, and one random weakness.*

9. **Prepare Role Card and Create Skill Decks:** Each hero finds the starting skill card for their role. Each starting skill card has the number “1” after the role name at the bottom of the card and has stars next to the card name. Each hero prepares their starting skill card by placing it face up below their hero card. Then, each player shuffles their remaining 14 cards together to create their skill deck and places it facedown in their play area.

> Image of a Trailblazer starting skill card and an arrow pointing to 3 dots which represents the starting skill card icon

*If Beravor is a Pathfinder, she places "Trailblazer" below her hero card.*

10. **Place Starting Tiles and Tokens:** Select "Embark" in the app and follow the app's instructions, placing map tiles and tokens in the play area as shown in the app to create the game map.

A unique alphanumeric code is printed on each map tile to make it easy both to find the tiles and to orient them when placing them. Be sure to leave extra room for additional map tiles to be placed during the game—the app displays fog next to the starting map tiles to indicate roughly where map tiles will be added later.

After following all the instructions in the app, the player begins their adventure.

## PLAYING THE GAME (page 6)

A game of *Journeys in Middle-earth* is played over a series of rounds. Each round has three phases that players resolve in the following order:

1. **Action Phase:** During this phase, the heroes move around the map, interact with the world, and attack enemies.

2. **Shadow Phase:** During this phase, the enemies move and attack heroes, and other dark threats grow stronger.

3. **Rally Phase:** During this phase, the heroes prepare for the next round.

After resolving each phase, a new round begins with the action phase. Players continue to resolve game rounds in this manner until the adventure ends.

### ACTION PHASE (page 6)

During the action phase, each hero takes a turn by performing actions to search, fight, and journey through the lands of Middle-earth. The heroes take turns in the order of their choice, and this order can change from round to round.

During a hero's turn, they can perform two actions, which may be the same action twice. The actions are:

- Travel

- Attack

- Interact

After all heroes have taken a turn, they select the hourglass button in the lower-right corner of the app screen to proceed to the shadow phase.

> Image of an hourglass button

#### TRAVEL ACTION (page 6)

The travel action allows a hero to move around the game map. The game map is composed of map tiles, each of which is divided into one or more spaces. A space is an area of the board enclosed by gray borders. Spaces that share a gray border are adjacent to each other.

> Image of a map tile and arrows pointing to the top left and bottom right of the map tile indicating "Gray Borders" and "Spaces"

When a hero performs a travel action, they can move twice. Each time a hero moves, they move to an adjacent space.

> Image of a map tile and arrows illustrating a two space Legolas move to the left. This move indicates that a hero performed a travel action.

*Legolas moves two spaces to the left.*

A hero can interrupt their two moves to perform the second action of their turn. For example, a hero can move one space, perform their second action, and then move one additional space.

##### EXPLORATION (page 6)

Each journey map tile has a square box where an exploration token may be placed, as indicated by the app. A map tile that has an exploration token on it is **UNEXPLORED.** When a hero moves into any space on an unexplored tile, they must immediately explore the tile.

> Image of a circled star icon representing an exploration token placed in a map tile.

To explore a tile, the hero selects the appropriate exploration token in the app and then selects the "Confirm" button. The app instructs the hero to discard the exploration token and gain one inspiration. To do this, the hero can simply flip the exploration token and place it on their hero card. Inspiration is described later.

Exploring a tile is **not** a separate action; it is simply the result of a hero moving onto a tile that has an exploration token.

> Image showing an exploration token and a legolas moved into a greyed-out map tile indicating an unexplored tile and a moving arrow indicating that the exploration token was discarded, one insipiration token was gained and placed on the chosen hero's stats card

*Legolas moved into an unexplored tile. so he must explore it. He discards the exploration token and gains one inspiration, which he places on his hero card.*

#### Attack Action (page 7)

The attack action allows heroes to attack an enemy group, attempting to remove it from the map. An enemy group is one or more plastic figures of the same type that move and attack together. Each enemy group has a corresponding portrait in the app:

> Image of one group of two warrior orcs figures

*One Group of Two Orc Figures.*

> Image of the orc group portrait in the app

*Orc Group Portrait in App.*

To perform an attack, the hero chooses an item to attack with. The item must have a stat icon in the upper-left corner of the card:

> Image of an item card and an arrow pointing to a circled stat icon on the upper-left corner of the item card

> Image of 5 stat icons available for the user which look like the 5 elements

The hero also must choose one enemy group that is in range. If an enemy group is in the same space as the hero, that enemy group is in range. Enemy groups in spaces adjacent to the hero are also in range if the hero is attacking with an item card that has the ranged (icon of a right-pointed dart with a white-shape right-pointed arrow in it) icon in the upper-right corner.

> Image of an item card and an arrow pointing to a circled ranged icon on the upper-right corner of the item card

After the hero chooses an item and an enemy group, they resolve an attack test against that enemy group. Tests are described later in "Tests" on page 10.

#### INTERACT ACTION (page 7)

The interactive action allows heroes to encounter points of interest on the map, which are indicated by search, person, and threat tokens. Interacting with these tokens is how heroes progress the adventure, discover items, gain experience, and neutralize threats.

> Image of a search token with the design of an eye in an inverted square.

*Search Token*

> Image of a person token with a design of a person on it.

*Person Token*

> Image of a threat token showing a design of a blazing red fire or sun.

*Threat Token*

If a hero is in the same space as one of these tokens, that hero can perform an interact action by selecting the token in the app and then selecting the button with the action (icon of two right-faced arrow) icon. When performing an interact action, the app provides the hero with instructions to follow. Then, the hero continues their turn.

> Image showing a request with two action buttons cancel and search. This image shows that an hero can either perform an interact action to search a token or cancel

*A hero can perform an interact action to search this search token.*

### INSPECTING TOKENS IN THE APP (page 7)

Players can inspect tokens in the app at any time by selecting them and reading their text, which usually describes what the token represents. Inspecting is not an action, and the player can select the "Cancel" button to close the token's description. However, if a player selects the button preceded by the (icon of two right-faced arrows), they are performing an interact action and must meet the requirements for doing so. Similarly, while inspecting an exploration token, they should not select the "Confirm" button unless their hero is exploring that token.

### ADDING MAP TILES (page 7)

The app instructs players to place new map tiles when certain conditions are met—these conditions include exploring and interacting with tokens, defeating enemies, etc. When the app instructs the players to place a tile, it highlights the alphanumeric code on that tile. The players should use this highlight to help orient the tile with the rest of the map.

### SHADOW PHASE (page 8)

The shadow phase is evil's opportunity to strike back and hinder the heroes' progress. To resolve the shadow phase, the app guides the heroes through the following steps: enemy activation, darkness, and threat. After the shadow phase, the heroes proceed to the rally phase.

#### ENEMY ACTIVATION STEP (page 8)

During the enemy activation step, each enemy group attempts to move and attack. The app provides an enemy group with a target to move toward and attack:

> Image of activation request showing two action buttons of "attack" and "no target".

First, the enemy group moves up to the indicated number of spaces toward the targeted hero, taking the shortest path of spaces possible. The enemy group stops when it is in **RANGE** of that hero. The enemy is in range if it is in the hero's space or if it is in an adjacent space **and** has the ranged ( icon of a right-pointed dart with a white-shaped right-pointed arrow in it ) icon on its enemy portrait.

> Image of a ranged icon on a portrait.

*Ranged Icon on Portrait*

If the enemy group cannot get in range of its target but can get in range of another hero, that closer hero **becomes the new target**. If multiple heroes satisfy this condition, the heroes choose which one becomes the new target.

If the enemy can get in range of a target, the "Attack" button is selected and the app displays the amount of damage (icon of 3 claw scratches) and fear (icon of a devil-like face with two curved horns) that the hero might suffer. Suffering damage and fear are described on page 12.

> Image showing the 3 damage strikes of the enemy represented with claws scratches and the 1 fear that the hero might suffer represented with a devil-like face with two curved horns.

*The Enemy Attacks For 3 Damage (icon of 3 claw scratches) And 1 Fear (icon of a devil-like face with two curved horns).*

If the enemy group cannot get in range of any target, **it ignores the entire instruction**, and the "No Target" button is selected. This provides the enemy with a new instruction, which usually moves the enemy closer to a hero.

> Image of a map tile and an arrow describing the movement of an attack legolas towards the Gimli statue since it is within its reach.

*The Orc group is instructed, "Move 1: Attack Legolas (or closest hero)." It cannot reach Legolas' space to attack him; instead, it moves toward and attacks Gimli.*

#### DARKNESS STEP (page 8)

During the darkness step, darkness strikes fear into the hearts and minds of the heroes. Because darkness is not always present during an adventure, the heroes only resolve this step when the app instructs them to do so.

A hero is in darkness if any of the following three conditions apply: 

- They are in a space with a printed darkness icon.

*Darkness Icon*

> Image of a map tile and an arrow pointing to the darkness icon in a space of the map tile

- They are in a space with a darkness token.

- The app states that they are in darkness.

To resolve the darkness step, each hero in darkness suffers an amount of fear indicated by the app. Suffering fear is described on page 12.

> Image showing both Gimli and Legolas on a map tile suffering the amount of fear indicated by the app during the darkness phase

*Both Gimli and Legolas suffer the amount of fear indicated by the app during the darkness phase because they are in spaces with a printed darkness icon.*

#### THREAT STEP (page 9)

As time passes for the heroes, the threats of Middle-earth draw closer and become more dangerous. During the threat step, threat increases and threat events may occur.

Threat is represented by a threat bar at the top of the app screen, which fills as threat increases. When threat increases to a **threshold**, a threat event is activated in the app and heroes resolve it by following its instructions. Each threshold has a number that indicates the amount of threat required for it to activate. If the threat bar ever fills, the game ends and the heroes fail the adventure.

> Image of a threat bar of a chosen hero as it fills up

*As the threat bar fills, the heroes will be subject to ever greater dangers.*

Threat increases during each threat step by the following amounts: 

- two for each hero playing

- one for each threat token on the map

- one for each unexplored tile

Additionally, some effects can cause threat to increase during other game phases. The app always calculates and increases threat automatically. At any time, a hero can select a threshold in the app to view a brief description of its event.

> image of the threshold activation with 15 as the minimum for it to activate and the level of the current threat step out of 64.

*This threshold activates during the threat step if threat is 15 or higher.*

### RALLY PHASE (page 9)

After the shadow phase, the app instructs the heroes to plan for the next round.

First, each hero **RESETS** their skill deck by shuffling their discard pile into their deck. Then, the app instructs the heroes to "**Scout 2.**" A hero does this by revealing the top two cards of their skill deck. Then, the hero may **PREPARE** one of them by placing it below their hero card. If a card is prepared, the abilities on that card are available to be used.

> Image showing the preview of an Elven Light card

> An image of a Elena hero card displaying her attributes: Might, Wisdom, Agility, Spirit, and Wit, as well as Fear, Damage thresholds and an inspiration with a limit of 5 at it upper-right corner.

> Image of a prepared Elven Light card placed below an Elena hero card and an undying might card.

*When Elena prepares Elven Light, she places it below her hero card.*

A hero can only have four skill cards prepared at a time, so it is important that their prepared cards are separated from any other cards they have in their play area. If a hero ever has more than four prepared cards, they must discard cards until only four prepared cards remain.

After choosing whether or not to prepare a card, each hero places their cards that were not prepared on the top or bottom of their deck in any order. By placing useless cards, like weaknesses, on the bottom of their deck and useful cards, such as cards that have the (a sunburst symbol)(success) icon in the upper-left corner, on the top of their deck, a hero can help ensure that their upcoming actions have positive outcomes.

After scouting, the heroes select the "Continue" button and proceed to a new round, starting with the action phase.

## COMPLETING AN ADVENTURE (page 9)

The party of heroes wins or loses an adventure together. Winning an adventure provides the heroes with greater rewards; however, whether they win or lose, all of the heroes proceed to the next adventure of the campaign. After completing their first adventure, players should read the "Campaign Rules" section in the Rules Reference—these rules describe how heroes can upgrade their items and purchase new skills before the next adventure begins.

#### OBJECTIVES (page 9)

Each adventure provides the heroes with a series of objectives. During an adventure, the heroes' current objective is displayed beneath the threat bar. After the heroes complete one objective, the app provides the heroes with a new objective automatically.

> Image of an objective completion bar beneath a threat bar. The objective completion bar fills as you complete objective

If the heroes complete the final objective before the threat bar is full, they win the adventure. If a hero is defeated, the remaining heroes continue playing; however, if they do not complete the final objective by the start of the next shadow phase, they lose the adventure.

## TESTS (page 10)

Tests are the primary way that heroes interact with the world and attack enemies. Heroes regularly perform tests when they are exploring, encountering threats, attacking enemies, and interacting with the people of Middle-earth.

Each test requires a hero to use one of their stats, which are listed on their hero card: agility (icon of a 3-pointed spiral), might (icon of a horn), spirit (icon of a blazing fire), wisdom (icon of a tree), or wit (speed motion icon). To perform a test, a hero reveals cards from the top of their skill deck. The number of cards they reveal is equal to the value of the stat being tested.

> Image of three cards revealed from a deck after a test is performed

*Beravor's might (icon of a horn) is "3." When she performs a (icon of a horn) test, she reveals three cards from her deck.*

After revealing cards, the hero determines the number of **SUCCESSES** (a sunburst symbol) they have. Each success (a sunburst symbol) icon on the upper-left corner of revealed cards provides one success. The text on the revealed cards is ignored—it has no effect during tests.

> Image of a Success Icon

*Success Icon*

The hero uses successes differently depending on the test:

- Some tests require the hero to input the number of successes into the app by selecting the "+" button. Then, the app provides the outcome of the test. The successes for some of these tests are cumulative; the heroes can perform the test multiple times, and the app tracks the total number of successes.

> Image showing the total number of sucesses after the app tracks the number of time an hero performs the test.

*If a hero has two successes, they select the "+" twice.*

- Some tests provide a number that indicates how many successes are required to pass (e.g., "Test (icon of a blazing fire); 1"). If the hero has successes equal to or greater than the required number, they pass the test. Otherwise, they fail the test. In either situation, the app provides the hero with further instructions.

- Successes are used in different ways when attacking enemies and when negating damage and fear, both of which are described later.

After completing the test, the hero places all the cards they revealed during the test into their skill deck discard pile.

#### FATE AND INSPIRATION (page 10)

During a test, a hero's revealed cards may contain fate (leaf icon) icons. Fate icons have no inherent effect; however, the hero can spend inspiration tokens to convert fate icons to success (a sunburst symbol) icons. Each inspiration spent converts a **single** fate icon. To spend an inspiration, the hero takes an inspiration from their hero card and returns it to the supply.

When a hero gains inspiration, they take an inspiration token from the supply and place it on their hero card. The hero cannot have more inspiration tokens than the inspiration limit indicated on their hero card.

> Image of a Hero Card with a limit of 4 Inspiration token

*Inspiration Limit Of 4 On Hero Card*

### TEST EXAMPLE (page 10)

> Image of an interact action with 2 action buttons of fail and pass

1. Bilbo performs an interact action on a search token in his space. He is prompted to test agility (icon of a 3-pointed spiral) with a goal of two successes.

> An image showing a deck of cards on the left with an arrow pointing to three revealed cards arranged horizontally. A large white oval encircles the success icon on the first card and the two fate icons on the second and third cards, highlighting the icons at the top of each revealed card.

2. Bilbo's agility is "3," so he reveals three cards from the top of his skill deck. The revealed cards have a total of one success (a sunburst symbol) icon and two fate (leaf icon) icons.

>An image of a Bilbo hero card displaying his attributes: Might, Wisdom, Agility, Spirit, and Wit, as well as Fear and Damage thresholds. An inspiration token with a limit of 6 is highlighted, with an arrow pointing from this token to a matching inspiration token outside the card, indicating that one inspiration token has been spent.

3. Bilbo wants to pass the test, so he spends an inspiration token to convert one (leaf icon) to (a sunburst symbol). Now he has two (a sunburst symbol), enough to pass the test.

> An image showing three revealed cards laid out horizontally on the right, with an arrow pointing toward a deck of cards on the left. This indicates that the revealed cards are being moved to the skill deck’s discard pile.

4. Bilbo selects "Pass" and resolves the instructions that appear. Then, he discards the cards he drew for the test to his skill deck discard pile.

### ATTACk TESTS (page 11)

Attack tests are performed during a hero's attack after the hero chooses an enemy group to attack and an item to attack with. To perform an attack test, the hero chooses one of the stats listed in the upper-left corner of the item card they are attacking with and tests that stat. Then, the hero spends successes (a sunburst symbol) to resolve one or more of that item's abilities. Each ability indicates how many successes must be spent to resolve it, and each ability can be resolved only once per attack.

*A hero using "Sword" tests (icon of a horn). One (a sunburst symbol) can be spent to apply two hits, and two (a sunburst symbol) icon applies five hits.*

> Image showing the sword tests and the hits it delivers

Most item abilities add hits to enemies. To add hits, the hero selects the enemy's portrait to display the enemy menu and then the attack tab to display the attack pane of the menu. Then, the hero selects the "+" button in the attack pane to input each hit.

> Image of an attack tab

*Attack Tab*

> Image showing the attack modifier a hero can use also with the Plus(+) and minus(-) buttons for hits

*Attack Pane of an Enemy Menu*

In addition to applying hits, abilities may provide heroes with attack modifiers, such as "pierce," which allows a hero to bypass an enemy's armor. If an ability has a modifier, the hero selects the matching modifier in the app. The app calculates the effect of each modifier automatically; each modifier is described in the Quick Reference on the back page of this book.

The enemy menu displays a health value for **each figure** in the enemy group as well as each figure's armor or sorcery value. If an enemy has armor or sorcery, hits reduce those values first. If an enemy does not have armor or sorcery, hits reduce the enemy's health.

> An image displaying a segmented progress bar with three different types of sections. From left to right, there are four red segments labeled as Health, followed by two purple segments labeled as Sorcery, and one gray segment labeled as Armor. Each section is highlighted with arrows to indicate its corresponding attribute.

After inputting all hits and modifiers, the hero selects the "Apply" button to apply the hits to the enemies (even if the hero had no hits). If an enemy's health is reduced to zero, that enemy is defeated and the app instructs the heroes to remove the enemy's figure from the board.

If an enemy is not defeated, it regains all of its armor and sorcery, and it may be prompted to counterattack. The enemy group can attack if it is in the hero's space or in an adjacent space and has the ranged (icon of a right-pointed dart with a white-shaped right-pointed arrow in it) icon on its portrait. If the enemy can attack, the hero selects the "Yes" button and resolves an attack as described in "Enemy Activation Step" on page 8.

> An image showing a ranged icon positioned on the bottom edge of a character portrait, indicating that the character has a ranged attack ability in adjacent spaces.

### Attack Test Example (page 11)

> Image of Aragorn attacking a group of wights figures in his space on the map tile

> Image of a Fate-Bender card showing a test of either might or wisdom.

1. Aragorn attacks a group of Wights in his space with his Fate-Bender. Fate-Bender tests either might (icon of a horn) or wisdom (icon of a tree); Aragorn's wisdom is higher, so he chooses wisdom.

> Image of the level "4" Aragorn's wisdom displayed

> Image of four revealed cards arranged horizontally from Aragorn's deck. A large white oval encircles the success icon on the first card, the two fate icons on the second and third cards and the last success icon on the fourth card, highlighting the icons at the top of each revealed card

2. Aragorn's wisdom is "4," so he reveals four cards from his deck. The cards he reveals have two successes (a sunburst symbol) and two fate (leaf icon).

> Image of the spending of 2 success tokens and a 5 hit count from Aragorn to resolve Fate-Bender's third effect

> Image showing the inputs of 5 hits in the app

3. Aragorn spends two success (a sunburst symbol) to resolve Fate-Bender's third effect,
inputting five hits into the app

> Image of Aragon spending (a sunset symbol) on Fate-Bender's first effect to get two hits and to also select "smite"

> Image of the Fate-Bender adding two hits and selecting "smite"

4. Aragorn spends an inspiration to convert one fate (leaf icon) to success(a sunburst symbol). He spends that success (a sunburst symbol)on Fate-Bender's first effect, adding two more hits and selecting "Smite." Then, he selects "Apply."

> An image showing the effect of the hit of Aragorn on the Wights's health

5. The app applies seven hits directly to the Wights' health (smite ignores their sorcery). One Wight is defeated, so Aragorn removes a Wight from his space and gains an inspiration token. Then, he discards the cards he revealed to his discard pile.

> Image showing a prompt to the enemy to attack.

6. The Wight group is prompted to attack. Since it is in range of Aragorn, he selects "Yes" and resolves an enemy attack.

## DAMAGE AND FEAR (page 12)

Middle-earth is rife with dangerous enemies and other threats that imperil the intrepid heroes. As a result of these threats, the heroes may suffer damage (icon of 3 claw scratches) and fear (icon of a devil-like face with two curved horns). If a hero suffers too much damage or fear, they are on the verge of being defeated and must perform a last- stand test to determine if they succumb to the threats of Middle-earth or rally and continue their adventure.

When a hero suffers a damage or fear, they reveal a damage or fear card from the appropriate deck and place it **faceup** in their play area. Then, they resolve the card's effect. Many of these cards instruct the hero to flip the card facedown or discard it. If a hero is instructed to keep the card faceup, it has a persistent effect that continues to apply to that hero. If a hero suffers multiple damage or fear at the same time, they reveal each card **one at a time**, resolving the card completely before revealing another card.

Occasionally, a hero is specifically instructed to suffer facedown damage or fear. When this occurs, the hero places that damage or fear facedown next to their hero card without reading the card's text.

### NEGATING DAMAGE AND FEAR (page 12)

A hero may be granted a chance to negate damage or fear before they suffer it. When this occurs, the hero is presented with a stat to test (e.g., "Each hero in darkness suffers 2 fear; (icon of blazing fire) negates."). Before suffering the damage or fear, the hero may test the indicated stat, and each success (a sunburst symbol) icon produced during that test prevents one damage or fear.

### LAST STANDS (page 12)

Through their trials and ordeals, the heroes may be brought to the limits of what their bodies and spirits can endure. Each hero has damage and fear limits on their hero card:

> Image of stats showing agility(3), spirit(3), wit(2), inspiration token(4), fear(5), and damage(5) and an arrow pointing to the stats of the fear and damage indicating their limits

*Damage and Fear Limits*

After a hero has suffered damage or fear, if they have a number of damage (faceup or facedown) equal to or greater than their damage limit or a number of fear (faceup or facedown) equal to or greater than their fear limit, that hero must perform a **LAST STAND**. To perform a last stand, the hero selects the party button in the lower-left corner of the app. Then, they select the hero's portrait and the limit (damage or fear) that was reached. Then, they follow the app's instructions.

> An image of a party button

*Party Button*

If a hero reaches both of their limits, they perform two last stands in the order of their choice.

A last stand includes a test—if the hero fails the test, they are **defeated**. The hero is removed from the board and the party loses the adventure in the next shadow phase unless they complete the final objective. If the hero passes the test, they follow the instructions provided by the app.

### SUFFERING DAMAGE EXAMPLE (page 12)

> A picture of three damages and 1 fear indicating that Elena was attacked by a Goblins

1. A group of Goblins attacks Elena for three damage (icon of 3 claw scratches) and one fear (icon of a devil-like face with two curved horns). For this attack, a might (icon of a horn) test negates damage and fear.

> Image of Elena revealing two of her cards from her deck. A large white oval encircles the success icons at the upper-left of both cards

2. Elena's might is "2," so she reveals two cards from her deck. She has two successes (a sunburst symbol), so she can prevent a total of two damage or fear. She chooses to prevent one damage and one fear, so only two damage remains.

> Image of a Feeble damage card and Elena's hero card picture with arrows pointing to a facedown fear card and a facedown Feeble damage card

3. The first damage card she reveals is "Feeble," which instructs her to suffer a facedown fear card and flip "Feeble" facedown.

> An Entangled card is shown with Elena's hero player card

4. The second damage card Elena reveals is "Entangled." "Entangled" instructs Elena to keep the card faceup. It will continue to impede her movement during this adventure until she is able to discard it or flip it facedown.

An enemy group is either **READIED** or **EXHAUSTED**. Enemies become exhausted either after the app activates them or after they attack. When an enemy is exhausted, its portrait in the app is darkened.

Exhausted enemies cannot activate, counterattack, or be provoked. The app readies all enemy groups at the end of the shadow phase.

#### PROVOKING ENEMIES (page 13)

While a hero is in the same space as a readied enemy group, certain actions will **provoke** that enemy, causing it to attack. A hero must provoke an enemy during each of the following situations: 

- before a hero moves out of a space that has a readied enemy

- before a hero interacts with a token in a space that has a readied

To provoke an enemy, a hero selects the provoke button to the left of the enemy portraits in the app. Then, they select the portrait of the enemy that is provoked. That enemy immediately resolves an enemy attack against the hero as instructed by the app. After the enemy attacks, the hero can move out of that enemy's space, or perform an interact action as intended.

*Provoke Button*

Unlike an enemy activation or counterattack, an enemy group is not exhausted when it is provoked.

#### INTERRUPTING ENEMY ACTIVATIONS (page 13)

Some abilities, such as Elena's "Child of the Lhûn" skill card, can interrupt an enemy's activation to apply hits or modifiers. To resolve these abilities, the hero selects the enemy's portrait, inputs and applies hits or modifiers indicated by the ability, then continues the enemy's activation.

#### PLACING ENEMIES (page 13)

When an enemy group needs to be placed on the map, the app indicates where the group is placed and how many figures are in the group. When an enemy group is placed, the app adds that enemy group's portrait to the enemy bar along the bottom of the screen. There should be one enemy group (containing one or more figures) on the game map for each enemy portrait shown in the app.

#### Elite Enemies (page 13)

Elite enemy groups are stronger than standard enemies, and they have special bonuses. An elite enemy group's portrait has a spiked frame and banner icon. When an elite enemy group is placed on the map, the heroes place the elite banner token (red background) that matches that enemy group's banner icon along with the enemy figures.

> A black elite enemy banner with a red background portrait

*Elite Enemy Portrait and Matching Enemy Banner*

An elite enemy group's bonuses are listed in its enemy menu. The app automatically applies all enemy bonuses, but the heroes can select bonuses in the enemy menu to view their effects. In addition to their listed bonuses, all elite enemies are able to perform counterattacks **even when they are exhausted.**

#### DUPLICATE ENEMY GROUPS (page 13)

It is possible for there to be multiple enemy groups of the same type that are not elite. When this happens, each additional enemy group is automatically assigned an enemy banner, which is presented next to that enemy's portrait in the app. When the heroes place the duplicate enemy group on the board, they place the matching enemy banner token next to that group's figures.

### PREPARED SKILL CARDS (page 14)

As described in the rally phase, when a hero scouts cards, that hero can prepare one of those cards by placing it faceup below their hero card. A hero cannot have more than **four** prepared cards; if they would prepare a fifth card, they must discard one of their prepared cards.

Like hero and item cards, skill cards have abilities that help the heroes accomplish their goals. However, a skill card's abilities can be used **only while that card is prepared**—in other words, the heroes ignore abilities on skill cards that are revealed for a test.

Each card ability describes when the ability can be used. To use an ability, the hero resolves the ability's text. Many skill card abilities instruct the hero to discard the card from their prepared area.

#### KEYWORDS (page 14)

Most skill cards contain one or more bolded keywords, such as "**Sprint 1.**" Keywords are a shorthand for abilities that appear on cards frequently. The rules for each of the keywords can be found in the Quick Reference on the back page of this rulebook.

#### TRAITS (page 14)

Some skill cards (and item cards) contain italicized traits such as "*Dwarf"* and "*Tactic.*" Traits have no inherent effects; however, other game effects may refer to cards that have traits.

#### NEARLY (page 14)

Some abilities and rules refer to **NEARBY** components or spaces. A component is nearby another component if they share the same space or are in spaces that are adjacent to each other. A nearby space refers to that space and all spaces adjacent to it. A component is **not** nearby itself.

#### APPLY (page 14)

Abilities that "apply" hits and modifiers to enemies are **not** attacks. To resolve these abilities, the hero inputs hits and modifiers in the enemy's menu and selects "Apply," but the hero always selects "No" if the app prompts a counterattack.

### SPECIAL SKILL CARDS (page 14)

Weakness and title cards are special types of skill cards that are part of the heroes' skill decks.

#### TITLE CARDS (page 14)

Title cards reflect a hero's memorable choices during a campaign. Title cards usually have powerful abilities that can be used only once during an adventure. When a hero gains a title card, they search the unused title skill cards for the specified card and prepare it immediately.

#### WEAKNESS CARDS (page 14)

Each hero begins the game with one weakness card in their skill deck. Weakness cards have no inherent effect—their purpose is to be useless to heroes, cluttering skill decks and contributing no icons during tests. When a hero gains a weakness card during an adventure, they take the top card of the weakness deck and place it in their skill deck discard pile. A hero can prepare a weakness card to temporarily remove it from their skill deck even though it does not grant any abilities.

### RESETTING SKILL DECKS (page 14)

A hero must reset their skill card deck at the following times:

- during the rally phase

- when there are no cards remaining in their deck

- when an effect instructs them to do so

A hero resets their deck by shuffling their discard pile with any remaining cards in their deck and placing the newly shuffled deck facedown. Prepared cards are not shuffled into the deck.

### BOON CARDS (page 14)

Heroes can become hidden, emboldened, or determined. These are boons that improve a hero's chances to battle enemies and pass tests. If a hero gains a boon, they take a boon card of the appropriate type and place it in their play area. The effect of each boon is described on the card.

### TRINKET ITEM CARDS (page 14)

Heroes may find trinkets during their adventures. Trinkets are item cards that have the trinket (sack of coins icon) icon along the bottom. When a hero gains a trinket, they search the unused item cards for the specified card and place it faceup next to their other items. Then, they place a number of depletion tokens on the trinket equal to the number in the lower-left corner of the card.

*Starting Number of Depletion Tokens*

> Image of a Trinkets "Boots" item card with an arrow pointing to a number 2 which indicates the starting number of depletion tokens

*The trinket "Boots" starts with two depletion tokens.*

If a hero is instructed to **DEPLETE** a trinket, they must spend one depletion token by removing it from that trinket's card. After a trinket's last depletion token is spent, the trinket is flipped facedown and cannot be used again during that adventure. Trinkets receive their starting number of depletion tokens at the beginning of each adventure.

### DUAL-WIELDING (page 14)

A hero can attack with more than one item if those items all share the stat that is being tested. When attacking with more than one item, the hero can spend successes (a sunburst symbol) to resolve abilities on any of the chosen items. If the hero is attacking an adjacent enemy group, all of the chosen items must have the ranged (icon of a right-pointed dart with a white-shaped right-pointed arrow in it) icon.

*A hero with "Sword" and "War-Maker" can use both items during an attack if testing might (icon of a horn).*
 
### APP ELEMENTS (page 15)

This section describes additional details related to the app.

#### LORE AND EXPERIENCE (page 15)

During an adventure, the heroes may be rewarded with lore and experience. These resources are tracked in the app and allow the heroes to upgrade items and purchase new skills between adventures. Players can ignore lore and experience for their first adventure; they are described in more detail in the Rules Reference.

#### FOG (page 15)

In the app, the portion of the map that is shrouded in fog indicates the locations where tiles will be placed. This informs players where the map expands so they can better set up their play area.

> A graphic representation of a fog in the color of white about to cover the map tiles

*The fog indicates that the map will expand west of the currently placed tiles.*

### WHAT NOW? (page 15)

Now you are ready to play your first adventure, so launch the app and carefully proceed through the setup steps on pages 4–5. You can use the Quick Reference on the back page to remind you of the phases and game terms. If you have questions during play, consult the glossary in the Rules Reference.

After you complete your first adventure, read the "Advanced Rules" and "Campaign Rules" sections of the Rules Reference. These sections explain the rules for battle map tiles, terrain tokens, and upgrading your heroes' skills and items. Then, you will be ready to start your next adventure!

## QUICK REFERENCE (page 16)

### ROUND STRUCTURE (page 16)

Each game round consists of the following three phases:

1. **Action Phase:** Each hero takes a turn by performing two actions.

2. **Shadow Phase:** Enemies activate, darkness is resolved (if necessary), and threat increases—threat events are activated if threat reaches a threshold.

3. **Rally Phase:** Each hero resets their skill deck and then scouts two cards.

### ACTIONS (page 16)

During a hero's turn, they can perform two actions. A hero can perform the same action twice or two different actions. 

- **Travel:** Move up to two times. A hero can perform their second action between their first and second movement.

- **Attack:** Attack an enemy in your space. If you have a ranged weapon, you can attack a nearby enemy.

- **Interact:** Interact With A Token In Your Space.

### RESETTING SKILL DECK (page 16)

A hero must reset their deck at the following times: 

- during the rally phase

- when there are no cards remaining in their deck

- when an effect instructs them to do so

A hero resets their deck by shuffling their discard pile with any remaining cards from their deck and placing the newly shuffled deck facedown. Prepared cards are not shuffled into the deck.

### FREQUENTLY OVERLOOKED RULES (page 16)

- When instructed to move and attack, if an enemy cannot get in range of any target, it ignores that entire instruction (including movement). The "No Target" button is selected and the enemy receives a new instruction.

- A readied enemy is provoked when a hero moves out of its space or when a hero interacts with a token in its space.

- A component is nearby another component if they are in the Same Space Or Adjacent Spaces.

- A hero can have a maximum of four prepared cards at a time.

### ATTACK MODIFIERS (page 16)

There are six modifiers that can benefit heroes during an attack:

- **Pierce:** This attack ignores the enemy's armor.

- **Smite:** This attack ignores the enemy's sorcery.

- **Sunder:** This attack permanently reduces the enemy's armor by one (before hits are applied).

- **Cleave:** Each enemy in the group suffers the full number of hits.

- **Lethal:** If this attack reduces the enemy's current health by at least half, the enemy is defeated.

- **Stun:** This attack exhausts the enemy group. If the group is elite, it also cannot counterattack this attack.

### KEYWORDS (page 16)

- **Scout X:** When an effect instructs you to "Scout X," reveal X cards from the top of your skill deck. You may prepare one of those cards (place it faceup under your hero card). Then, place each of the remaining revealed cards on the top or bottom of your skill deck in any order.

- **Strike X:** During your attack test, you may discard a card that has the "Strike X" keyword to add X hits to the attack.

- **Guard X:** When you or a hero in your space would suffer damage or fear, you may discard a card that has the "Guard X" keyword to prevent any combination of X damage and fear.

- **Sprint X:** During your turn, you can discard a card that has the "Sprint X" keyword to move X additional spaces. You can perform actions between each movement.

- **Rest X:** At the end of your turn, you can discard a card that has the "Rest X" keyword to discard any combination of X of your facedown damage or fear cards.

- **Hide:** After performing a test, you can discard a card that has the "Hide" keyword to gain a "Hidden" boon card.
