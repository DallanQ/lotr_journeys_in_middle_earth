## USING THIS REFERENCE (page 2)

This document is the definitive source for all *The Lord of the Rings: Journeys in Middle-earth*™ rules. Before using this document, players should read and understand the rules presented in the Learn To Play book. After reading the Learn To Play and playing their first adventure, players should read both the "Advanced Rules" and "Campaign Rules" sections of this document. These sections contain rules that were omitted from the Learn To Play but are necessary for continuing and completing an entire campaign.

The majority of this Rules Reference is the glossary, which provides players with detailed game rules and clarifications listed in alphabetical order by topic. As questions arise during gameplay, the players should refer to the glossary. Players are also encouraged to use the index to find specific topics within the glossary entries.

This Rules Reference is divided into several sections:

### ADVANCED RULES ........................... 2

### CAMPAIGN RULES ........................... 3

### SETUP .................................... 5

### GLOSSARY ................................. 6

### APPENDIX: APP SCREEN ANATOMIES ........... 28

### INDEX .................................... 30

### QUICK REFERENCE .......................... 32

## ADVANCED RULES (page 2)

The following rules describe game rules that appear in the campaign after the first adventure.

### GOLDEN RULES (page 2)

The golden rules are the fundamental concepts on which all other game rules are built.

- If information in this Rules Reference contradicts the Learn To Play book, the Rules Reference takes precedence.

- If a card ability contradicts information in the Rules Reference, the card takes precedence. If both the card and the rules can be followed at the same time, they should be.

- If a card ability uses the word "cannot," it is absolute and cannot be overridden by other abilities.

- If An Ability In The App Contradicts Information In The Rules Reference or on cards, the app takes precedence.

### CONFLICTS (page 2)

During the game, some effects may lead to conflicts within the game.

- It is possible for multiple game effects to occur at the same time. When this happens, the players, as a group, determine the order in which those effects are resolved.

- It is possible for a game effect to have more than one possible outcome. In such a case, players as a group determine the outcome of that effect.

### BLACK BORDERS (page 2)

The edges of the dark journey map tiles that make up Middle-earth's mountains, caves, and halls have both gray borders and black borders. Spaces separated by black borders are not adjacent unless they are connected by gray borders that are aligned together. Arrows point to gray borders to help players identify them—when two gray borders are aligned, the arrows on each side of the aligned borders point toward each other.

If two spaces are separated by black borders and their gray borders are not aligned (in other words, if a gray border meets a black border), those spaces are not adjacent.

> Image of two adjacent game map areas (a rocky cavern and a stone chamber). They are connected by a narrow passage marked by a double-arrow gray border, indicating alignment and adjacency between the spaces.

*These two spaces are adjacent because they share aligned gray borders (border with two arrows).*

### THE BATTLE MAP AND TERRAIN (page 3)

Some adventures use a battle map that is composed of battle map tiles instead of the typical journey map tiles. The battle map is used when the focus of the campaign shifts from travel and exploration to a pivotal moment in the journey.

> Image of a map tile indicating the journey of a hero player

*Journey Map Tile*

>Image of a battle map tile depicting a textured, stone-paved surface with visible grid lines.

*Battle Map Tile*

When playing on a battle map, all of the rules of the game remain the same. However, adventures on a battle map may feature terrain tokens, which can affect movement and attack rules.

When setting up a battle map, the heroes place terrain tokens as indicated in the app. Some terrain tokens are placed in spaces and others are placed on borders, altering the rules of that border.

A player can select a terrain token in the app to review the terrain's rules, which may include the option of an interact action. Additionally, each terrain token has a corresponding terrain card that describes its effects.

Some adventures use adventure-specific terrain. These terrain tokens are highlighted in the app by a sparkle effect, and their effects are different from the effects described on the terrain cards. To review the rules for an adventure-specific terrain token, the heroes must select the terrain token in the app.

### SET ICONS (page 3)

There is a ring icon in the lower-right corner of all cards in *The Lord of the Rings: Journeys in Middle-earth* base game. This set icon distinguishes the cards in this product from the cards present in other *Journeys in Middle-earth* products.

> Image of a black ring with a white center.

*Base Game Set Icon*

## CAMPAIGN RULES (page 3)

Each campaign of *Journeys in Middle-earth* contains a series of adventures. This section describes rules for hero advancement that can occur between adventures, such as upgrading items, purchasing skills, and changing roles, and describes how to save and continue a campaign that is in progress.

### AFTER EACH ADVENTURE (page 3)

After each adventure, each hero discards all of their tokens and their damage, fear, and boon cards. Then, they return their weakness cards to the supply and return all other skill cards to their skill deck.

### CAMP (page 3)

After the heroes complete an adventure, a camp screen appears. While at camp, heroes can upgrade their items and purchase new skill cards. Then, the heroes can either select "Save & Quit" to save their campaign and return to the app's title screen or "Continue" to proceed to the role selection screen prior to beginning their next adventure.

> Image of a camp screen showing heroes and options to upgrade items, purchase new skill cards, save or quit the campaign, and continue the campaign.

*Camp Screen*

#### THE PARTY'S INVENTORY (page 3)

The inventory is a collection of the party's items and skills. The app tracks each hero's armor (icon of hero armor), one-handed (icon of left hand raised), and two-handed (icon of both left and right hands raised together) items as well as their skill cards, including titles. The app also tracks the entire party's collection of trinkets (sack of coins icon). Heroes can view their items by selecting the "Items" button, and they can view their skills by selecting their portraits.

Heroes **cannot** trade items and purchased skills; however, trinkets can be equipped by different heroes during setup.

To facilitate tracking over multiple game sessions, the heroes can keep the cards in their inventory separate from the other cards that are included in the game.

#### LORE (icon of a star in a circle) AND ITEMS (page 4)

The information the heroes have gathered and the knowledge they have obtained throughout the campaign is represented by **LORE** (icon of a star in a circle). All heroes share the lore they have gained, which is tracked in the app. As heroes gain lore, new item upgrades become available. Gained lore is permanent; it cannot be spent or lost.

> Image showing the total number of Lore "11" in a camp screen

*Total Lore is Camp Screen

##### UPGRADING ITEMS (page 4)

Each item card has a lore value that indicates the amount of lore the heroes must have to upgrade that item. The item menu displays all of the party's items; items that can be upgraded are highlighted.

> Image of an item card with a lore value indicating the amount of lore heroes need to upgrade the item

*Lore Value On Item Card*

> Image of an item menu showing the party's items, with upgradeable items highlighted in yellow.

*The heroes have enough lore to upgrade all of the highlighted items.*

When a highlighted item is selected from the item menu, any available upgrades for that item are displayed. To upgrade the item, the upgraded version is selected in the app. Then, the hero gains the card that corresponds to the upgrade and returns the card that was upgraded to the supply.

> Image of a camp screen displaying the option to upgrade a dagger to either a Gondolin Dagger or an Ered Luin Dagger

*At 25 lore, "Dagger" can be upgraded to "Ered Luin Dagger" or "Gondolin Dagger."*

#### EXPERIENCE AND SKILLS (page 4)

As heroes complete adventures they gain experience, representing how their abilities grow and change in their travels. Experience is a currency that heroes spend to purchase new skill cards. Experience is gained by each hero individually and is specific to that hero's role—during an adventure, a hero gains experience for their current role. If a hero changes their role during the campaign, it is possible for them to have experience for multiple roles.

##### PURCHASING AND SELLING SKILLS (page 4)

While at camp, each hero can spend experience to purchase any number of skill cards. Skill cards that are available for purchase have an experience value that indicates the amount of experience a hero must spend to purchase that card.

> Image of a skill card with instructions, showing arrows pointing to the experience cost '7' and the role and card number labeled as 'Hunter 9

*Experience cost* *Role And Card Number*

A player can select their hero to open a menu that sorts that hero's experience by role. Selecting a role expands the menu, providing a list that contains all the skill cards that correspond to that role. Skill cards that a hero already has are colored green, skill cards that are too expensive to purchase are colored red, and skill cards that are unavailable because they belong to another hero are colored red and include a portrait of the hero who has that item.

> Image of a menu showing the roles available and skills corresponding to each roles

*Aragorn is a Burglar and has four experience in that role. He already has "Word of Fortune," so he can purchase either "Sneaking" or "Pockets" from the available Burglar skills.*

Skill cards that are not colored green or red are available for the hero to purchase. To purchase a skill card, a hero selects it from the list. The purchased skill will be marked green and any experience spent will be deducted from that hero automatically. Then, that hero adds that skill card to their skill deck. There is no limit to the number of cards a hero can have in their skill deck.

Heroes can also sell any skill cards they have purchased. To sell a skill card, a player selects it from the list and the hero gains experience equal to the sold card's experience value automatically—the experience gained is for the role displayed at the bottom of that skill card. Then, the hero **removes** that skill card from their skill deck and returns it to the available skill cards.

## SETUP (page 5)

To start a campaign of *Journeys in Middle-earth*, players follow the steps presented in the New Campaign section—these steps will set up everything they need for the first adventure of the campaign. To set up all subsequent adventures in the campaign, players follow the steps presented in the Continuing a Campaign section.

### NEW CAMPAIGN

1. **Select Campaign and Difficulty:** Select the "New Game" button on the app's title screen. Then, the app will guide the players through a series of screens for selecting a campaign, a difficulty, and a save slot.

2. **Create Party and Select Heroes:** Each player selects a hero in the app, takes their hero's corresponding figure and hero card, and places them in their play area. If playing a single-player game, the player chooses two heroes and controls both of them.

3. **Select Starting Items:** Each player selects their starting items and gathers the cards that match the name and tier displayed in the app and places them near their hero card.

4. **Create Damage, Fear, and Weakness Decks:** Shuffle the damage, fear, and weakness cards into separate decks and place them in the center of the play area where all players can reach them.

5. **Create Supply:** Separate all tokens and boon cards by type and place them in separate piles to create the supply. Set aside all map tiles and enemy figures.

6. **Begin Campaign:** The players input a group name, and then select "Begin" in the app and watch the short cutscene that introduces the story and the heroes' quest.

7. **Choose Role:** Each player selects a role in the app—this is the role their hero takes for the first adventure.

8. **Gather Skill Cards:** Each hero gathers the following cards for their skill deck and sets them aside:

- one copy of each skill card numbered 1–6 that has the word "Basic" On The Bottom Of The Card

- the skill cards numbered 1–5 that have the name of their Hero On The Bottom Of The Card

- the skill cards numbered 1–3 that have their role on the Bottom Of The Card

- one weakness card from the top of the weakness deck

9. **Prepare Role Card and Create Skill Decks:** Each hero prepares their skill card that has the number "1" after the role name at the bottom of the card. Then, each player shuffles their remaining 14 cards together to create their skill deck and places it facedown in their play area.

10. **Embark:** Players select "Embark" in the app to begin the next adventure of their campaign.

### CONTINUING A CAMPAIGN (page 5)

- the title cards a hero has gained (if any)

- one weakness card from the top of the weakness deck

5. **Equip Hero-Specific Items:** Each player places their hero card in their play area and equips their items, which are displayed in the item menu in the app. Equipped items are placed next to their hero card.

6. **Equip Trinkets:** Each hero may equip one trinket (sack of coins icon) from the inventory, which includes all trinkets that the party has gained during the campaign.

7. **Choose Role and Create Skill Deck:** Each player selects a role for the next adventure in the app—a hero is not committed to a single role for the entire adventure campaign. Then, the hero gathers the skill cards numbered 1–3 that have their role on the bottom of the cards. The hero prepares the card numbered 1. Then, the hero shuffles the cards numbered 2 and 3 with the set-aside cards from Step 4 to form the hero's skill deck for the adventure.

8. **Embark:** Players select "Embark" in the app to begin the next adventure of their campaign.

## GLOSSARY (page 6)

This glossary provides players with detailed rules for *Journeys in Middle-earth*, organized by topic. If a player is unable to find a topic, they should use the Index on page 30.

### 1  ABILITIES (page 6)

Most cards have abilities that heroes can use at various times during the game.

1.1 Each ability describes when a hero can use it and how its effects are resolved.

- A hero can only resolve an ability on a skill card while that skill card is prepared.

- If a skill card is not prepared—even when it is revealed during a test—the ability text on that skill card is ignored.

1.2 Some abilities are presented as keywords, which is shorthand for specific abilities that appear frequently on cards.

- Each keyword has specific rules that players can reference in that keyword's glossary entry.

1.3 When using an ability on a card with multiple abilities, only one can be used unless an ability specifically states that it is used before, when, or after the other ability is resolved.

#### 1.4 COSTS (page 6)

Many abilities have a cost that a hero must resolve to use that ability.

1.5 A hero cannot resolve an ability if they cannot resolve its cost.

1.6 Costs may include spending success (a sunburst symbol) icons, spending inspiration tokens, discarding cards, and depleting trinkets.

1.7 If multiple abilities have the same cost, a hero cannot resolve the cost once to resolve each of those abilities. Only one ability can be resolved per cost.

*Example: If a skill card has two abilities that require the skill card to be discarded—one text ability and one keyword—the hero cannot discard that card and resolve both of its abilities.*

1.8 An ability that requires a card to be discarded cannot be resolved if the card is discarded by another game effect.

1.9 If an ability instructs a hero to remove a card from the adventure, that card should be set aside and cannot be used again during that adventure.

#### 1.10 TIMING (page 6)

The timing of an ability refers to when a hero can resolve it.

1.11 If the timing of an ability uses the word "after," the ability's effect resolves immediately after the described timing event.

1.12 If the timing of an ability uses the word "before," the ability's effect resolves immediately before the described timing event.

1.13 If the timing of an ability uses the word "when," the ability's effect resolves at the moment of the described timing event.

1.14 Effects That Occur "when" An Event Occurs Take Precedence Over effects that occur "after" that same event.

1.15 If multiple abilities resolve at the same time, the party determines the order in which those abilities resolve.

1.16 If an ability uses the word "then," a hero must resolve the effect that occurs before the word "then," followed by the effect that occurs after the word "then."

### 3  ACTION PHASE (page 6)

The action phase is the first phase of a game round during which each hero takes a turn.

2.1 During the action phase, each hero takes a turn by performing up to two actions.

- The hero can perform the same action more than once.

- The hero can choose to perform zero actions or one action, instead of two.

2.2 The primary actions a hero can perform during the action phase are the travel action, attack action, and interact action.

2.3 Abilities may allow heroes to resolve game effects other than actions during their turn.

- If an ability allows a hero to move, attack, or interact, these abilities are not actions even though the effects are identical to those granted by performing actions.

2.4 The app may include adventure-specific rules that provide additional actions that a hero can perform.

2.5 Each round, the heroes can take turns in any order, but a hero must resolve their turn completely before another hero takes their turn.

2.6 After each hero has taken a turn during the action phase, the hourglass button is selected in the app and the game proceeds to the shadow phase.

### 3  ACTIONS (page 6)

There are three primary actions that a hero can perform during their turn of the action phase: travel action, attack action, and interact action.

3.1 The travel action allows a hero to move twice, the attack action allows a hero to perform an attack against an enemy group, and the interact action allows a hero to interact with tokens in their space.

3.2 The app may include adventure-specific rules that provide additional actions that a hero can perform and expand the ways in which a hero can travel, attack, or interact.

3.3 An ability that uses the language "as an action" indicates that the hero can perform that ability during their turn as one of their two actions.

3.4 If an ability allows a hero to move, attack, or interact, these abilities are not actions even though the effects are identical to those granted by performing actions.

### 4  ACTIVATION (page 7)

See "Enemy Activation" On Page 13.

### 5  ADD AND APPLY (page 7)

Abilities that add and apply hits differ in the following ways:

5.1 Some abilities, such as "Strike X," explicitly state to "add" hits or modifiers. These abilities alter an attack that is in progress.

5.2 Some abilities explicitly state to "apply" hits or modifiers—these abilities resolve outside of an attack. They are not attacks and cannot cause counterattacks.

- The hero inputs the hits and modifiers and selects "Apply" as though resolving an attack, but if prompted to resolve a counterattack, the hero selects "No."

### 6   ADJACENCY (page 7)

Borders are gray or black lines between spaces on the map. If a border between two spaces is gray, those spaces are adjacent.

6.1 If two spaces are adjacent, a hero or enemy can move from one of those spaces to the other.

6.2 Components that are in the same space or adjacent spaces are nearby each other.

6.3 Because it can be difficult to detect gray borders on tiles that also have black borders, gray borders on such tiles have a white arrow printed on them that points to each gray border.

6.4 Neither heroes nor enemies can move across black borders. However, two black-bordered tiles are adjacent if they each have at least one gray border that is aligned with a gray border on the other tile.

- When two gray borders are aligned, there are two white arrows pointing at each other—one arrow on each side of the aligned gray border.

6.5 If the border between two spaces on the battle map is covered by a stream token, those two spaces are adjacent and components in those spaces are nearby each other.

6.6 If the border between two spaces on the battle map is covered by a wall token, those two spaces are not adjacent and components in those spaces are not nearby each other.

- Heroes and enemy groups cannot move across a border covered by a wall token.

- If wall tokens create diagonal spaces, those spaces are not adjacent.

### 7   ADVENTURE (page 7)

An adventure is a single scenario of a *Journeys in Middle-earth* campaign.

7.1 Each campaign consists of multiple adventures played in order.

7.2 Between each adventure of a campaign, heroes can purchase skills, upgrade items, equip trinkets, and change their roles.

- Heroes cannot trade items. However, heroes can equip any available trinket from the item menu at the start of each adventure.

7.3 Most adventures occur on a journey map that represents large areas of Middle-earth.

7.4 Some adventures occur on a battle map, which is used when the focus of the campaign shifts from travel and exploration to a pivotal moment in the journey.

### 8   APP (page 7)

The *Journeys in Middle-earth* app guides the players through their campaign by providing narratives and objectives, generating maps and enemies, and determining when the heroes win or lose an adventure. The app also saves the party's progress and manages their inventory.

8.1 At any time, heroes can navigate the app's menus to view enemy information, the chronicle, and the party inventory. Heroes can also select tokens and threat thresholds to read information about those tokens and thresholds.

- Heroes cannot select a button that includes an interact (icon of 2 right-pointed arrows) icon without resolving an effect that allows them to do so, such as performing an interact action.

- To avoid accidentally applying hits or modifiers to an enemy group, it is recommended that players do not open the attack pane of an enemy menu unless they are resolving an effect that allows them to apply hits or modifiers to that enemy group.

8.2 The collection manager in the app allows players to select which *Journeys in Middle-earth* products they want to incorporate into the game's procedurally generated adventures.

8.3 An anatomy of the app's prominent screens and menus can be found in the appendix on page 28.

### 9  APPLY (page 7)

See "Add And Apply" On Page 7.

### 10  APPLYING HITS TO ENEMIES (page 8)

To defeat an enemy group, heroes must apply hits until no enemies in the group have health remaining.

10.1 The primary way that a hero can apply hits to an enemy group is by attacking it.

10.2 By selecting the attack tab from an enemy group's menu, a hero can open the attack pane that provides the hero with an interface for applying hits and modifiers to that enemy group.

10.3 To apply hits and modifiers to an enemy group, the hero selects the "+" button in the enemy group's attack pane once for each hit they wish to apply, and they select the modifier button for each modifier they wish to apply. Then, the hero must select the "Apply" button to apply the hits and the modifiers.

- As heroes add or subtract hits or select and deselect modifiers, the app dynamically displays how these hits and modifiers will be applied the enemy group.

- A hero can freely add or subtract hits and select or deselect modifiers in the attack pane without permanently altering an enemy group's state. However, after they select the "Apply" button, the hits and modifiers will be applied and cannot be reversed.

10.4 When resolving an attack, if the hero resolves multiple abilities on their item cards that add hits and modifiers, they input the hits and modifiers from all of their abilities before selecting the "Apply" button.

10.5 After applying hits and modifiers to an enemy group, the app provides the heroes with instructions to remove any enemy figures from the group that have been defeated. If any figures remain, the app may provide the hero with a counterattack prompt.

- If a counterattack prompts appears, and if the enemy is able to counterattack, the hero selects "Yes." Otherwise, the hero selects "No" (see "Counterattack" on page 10).

10.6 For each hit that is applied to an enemy group, the health bar of an enemy within that group is reduced by one.

- Hits reduce an enemy's armor or sorcery before they are able to reduce an enemy's health.

- If an enemy has both armor and sorcery, hits are applied to that enemy's armor before they are applied to that enemy's sorcery.

10.7 The app applies hits to a single enemy within an enemy group, attempting to defeat one enemy before applying hits to another enemy within the group.

- When the "cleave" modifier is selected, hits are applied to all enemies within a group instead of just a single enemy.

10.8 Some abilities explicitly state to "apply" hits or modifiers—these abilities resolve outside of an attack. They are not attacks and cannot cause counterattacks.

### 11  ARMOR (page 8)

Enemies and heroes can have armor, which makes them more difficult to defeat.

#### 11.1   ENEMY ARMOR (page 8)

An enemy group's armor is displayed as gray units on its health bar within its enemy menu.

11.2 When a hero applies hits to an enemy that has armor, the hits are applied to that enemy's armor before they are applied to that enemy's health.

- If an enemy has both armor and sorcery, hits are applied to that enemy's armor before they are applied to that enemy's sorcery.

11.3 After a hero selects the "Apply" button to apply hits to an enemy, any enemy that was not defeated regains any armor it had lost.

11.4 When the "pierce" modifier is selected, any hits that are applied to an enemy ignore that enemy's armor.

11.5 When the "sunder" modifier is selected, one or more enemies in the group permanently lose one armor.

- The topmost enemy displayed in the app permanently loses one armor. If that enemy is defeated, the next enemy displayed in the app permanently loses one armor as well.

#### 11.6   HERO ARMOR(ITEMS) (page 8)

Each hero has one armor item equipped during the campaign. Each armor item has an armor (icon of hero armor) icon printed on it.

11.7 Each hero's armor item provides them with one or more abilities that describe when they are used and how they are resolved.

- These abilities typically allow a hero to prevent damage (icon of 3 claw sratches) and fear (icon of devil-like face with two curved horns).

11.8 During the camp screen between adventures, a hero may be able to upgrade their armor if they have gained enough lore.

### 12  ATTACKS (page 9)

This entry contains separate sections for how to resolve hero and enemy attacks.

#### 12.1   HERO ATTACKS (page 9)

Heroes can attack enemy groups to defeat them and remove them from the map. The primary way that a hero attacks an enemy is by performing an attack action.

To resolve an attack, a hero performs the following steps, in order:

12.2 **Step 1—Choose Item and Stat:** The hero chooses any number of their equipped items to use for the attack. Then, the hero chooses a stat to test from those items.

- If the hero chooses multiple items, all items that they choose must have at least one stat in common, and the chosen stat must match an icon that is on all of the items that the hero has chosen.

12.3 **Step 2—Choose Target:** The hero chooses an enemy group as the target of the attack.

- The hero can target any enemy group that is in the same space as that hero.

- The hero can target an enemy group in an adjacent space if all of that hero's chosen items have the ranged (Icon of a right-pointed dart with a white shaped right pointed arrow in it) icon.

12.4 **Step 3—Perform Attack Test:** An attack test follows the same rules as a standard test (see "Tests" on page 25); however, the success (a sunburst icon) icons that the test produces are spent to resolve abilities on the item cards being used for the attack.

- Many abilities on item cards are preceded by a cost that is represented by a success (a sunburst symbol) icon and a value (e.g., 2(a sunburst symbol)). To resolve such an ability, the hero must spend a number of success (a sunburst symbol) icons from among those produced by the attack test equal to the cost's value. Then, they resolve the ability's text.

  - Most abilities add hits or modifiers to the enemy group that is being attacked. Heroes do this from that enemy group's menu in the app (see "Applying Hits to Enemies" on page 8).

- If an attack does not add any hits or modifiers to an enemy group, the hero still selects "Apply" in the attack pane, which can cause a counterattack.

- After performing an attack test, any enemies that are not defeated regain their armor and sorcery.

12.5 **Step 4—Counterattack:** After a hero attacks an enemy group, that enemy group may be able to attack the hero who attacked it.

- If the app provides the hero with a counterattack prompt, the hero selects "Yes" if the enemy is in range of the hero who attacked it. Otherwise, the hero selects "No."

#### 12.6   ENEMY ATTACK (page 9)

Enemy groups can attack heroes to defeat them and cause them to lose the game.

12.7 Typically, an enemy group attacks a hero when it activates, when it counterattacks, or when it is provoked.

12.8 When an enemy group attacks, the app provides the hero with a damage (icon of 3 claw scratches) value and a fear (icon of devil-like face with two curved horns) value. These values represent the amount of damage and fear the hero suffers.

- Typically, the hero has a chance to perform a test to negate damage (icon of 3 scratches claw) and fear (icon of devil-like face with two curved horns) before they suffer it.

12.9 In addition to damage (icon of 3 scratches claw) and fear (icon of devil-like face with two curved horns) values, some enemy attacks have additional text, which describe when and how they are resolved.

### 13  BARRELS (TERRAIN) (page 9)

Barrels are a type of terrain that can be placed on the battle map.(image of 3 barrels)

13.1 During the action phase, if a hero is nearby an enemy group and in a space with a barrels token, that hero can perform an interact action to interact with that barrels token.

13.2 If a hero is in a space with one or more enemies, performing an interact action to interact with a barrels token does not provoke enemy attacks.

13.3 When a hero interacts with a barrels token, they perform a wisdom (icon of a tree) test.

- If the test produces at least two success (a sunburst symbol) icons, the hero passes the test and can apply four hits and stun to one nearby enemy group of their choice. Then, they discard the barrels token.

- If the test produces fewer than two success (a sunburst symbol) icons, the hero

fails the test and nothing happens.

### 14  BATTLE MAP (page 9)

Battle maps are used during specific adventures that focus on tactical combat. When playing an adventure that uses battle maps, all the normal rules of the game apply with the following exceptions:

14.1 There are no unexplored battle map tiles, so heroes do not explore when they move.

14.2 Battle maps contain terrain tokens that each add rules to the adventures.

- Terrain can change how heroes and enemies move and attack.

- Terrain can provide heroes with abilities that they can resolve by performing interact actions.

14.3 If an ability, such as "Keen Eyes," allows for a hero or enemy to resolve a ranged attack that is up to two or more spaces away on a battle map, it may be possible for a hero or enemy to resolve a ranged attack against a target that is on the opposite side of a wall token.

### 15  BOON CARDS (page 10)

Boon cards can provide heroes with positive effects that aid them when performing tests, attacking enemies, or being attacked by enemies.

15.1 If a game effect instructs a hero to **become** hidden, emboldened, or determined, that hero gains a hidden, emboldened, or determined boon card, as appropriate.

15.2 When a hero gains a boon card, they take the appropriate boon card from the supply and place it faceup in their play area.

15.3 When a hero would gain a boon card that matches a boon card that they already have in their play area, they do not gain another copy of that boon card.

15.4 The ability on each boon card describes when it can be used and how its effect is resolved.

### 16  BOULDER (TERRAIN) (page 10)

A boulder is a type of terrain that can be placed on the battle map.

16.1 If a hero is in a space with a boulder token while performing a test to negate damage (icon of 3 scratches claw) and fear (icon of a devil-like face with two curved horns), that hero may convert one fate (leaf icon) icon to one success (a sunburst symbol) icon during the test without spending an inspiration token.

16.2 Each boulder token can be used one time during each negate test that is performed by a hero that shares a space with that boulder token.

### 17  BUSH (TERRAIN) (page 10)

A bush is a type of terrain that can be placed on the battle map. (image of a top view of a tree)

17.1 During the action phase, if a hero ends their turn in a space with a bush token, that hero may perform a wit (speed motion icon) test.

- If the test produces at least two success (a sunburst symbol) icons, the hero passes the test and becomes hidden, gaining a "Hidden" boon card.

- If the test produces fewer than two success (a sunburst symbol) icons, the hero fails the test and nothing happens.

- Performing this test is not an action.

17.2 If there are multiple bush tokens in a space, a hero can perform a wit (speed motion icon) test once for each bush token in that space.

### 18  CHRONICLE (page 9)

The chronicle is an archive of all the prompts that the app has provided to the hero throughout their entire campaign. The prompts are organized by both adventure and game round.

18.1 If the heroes wish to read past prompts, they select the party button in the lower-left corner of the app and proceed to the "Chronicle" tab.

### 19  CLEAVE (page 10)

See "Modifiers" On Page 19.

### 20  COLLECTION MANAGER (page 10)

The collection manager allows the app to generate content that uses components from other *Journeys in Middle-earth* products.

20.1 A Player Can Access The Collection Manager From The Title Screen.

20.2 Within the collection manager menu, a player can enable or disable each *Journeys in Middle-earth* product from which the app can generate content.

- When a product is enabled, the app may generate content that requires components from that product.

- When a product is disabled, the app cannot generate content that requires components from that product.

20.3 If a product is disabled in the collection manager, any saved campaigns that use those products cannot be loaded until those products are enabled.

### 21  COUNTERATTACK (page 10)

After a hero attacks an enemy group, that enemy group may be able to attack the hero who attacked it. After applying hits or modifiers to an enemy group in the app, the app may provide the hero with a counterattack prompt that reads, "Can the enemy attack?"

21.1 When the app provides the hero with a counterattack prompt, if the enemy group can attack, the hero selects "Yes." Otherwise, the hero selects "No."

21.2 An enemy group can counterattack if that enemy group is in range of who attacked it.

21.3 If a hero applies hits or modifiers to an enemy group because of a game effect other than an attack, that enemy group cannot counterattack.

21.4 A non-elite enemy group cannot counterattack if it is exhausted.

- After a hero applies hits to an exhausted enemy group, the app will *not* provide the hero with a counterattack prompt.

21.5 Elite enemy groups can counterattack if they are exhausted.

21.6 If the "stun" modifier was applied to an enemy group during an attack, that enemy group is exhausted, and if the enemy group is elite, it cannot counterattack.

21.7 If an attack does not add any hits or modifiers to an enemy group, the hero still selects "Apply" in the attack pane, which can cause a counterattack.

### 22  DAMAGE AND FEAR (page 11)

Damage (icon of 3 scratches claw) represents inflictions to a hero's body, and fear (icon of a devil-like face with two curved horns) represents inflictions to a hero's mind and soul.

#### 22.1   SUFFERING DAMAGE AND FEAR (page 11)

The threats of Middle-earth can cause heroes to suffer damage (icon of 3 scratches claw) or fear (icon of a devil-like face with two curved horns). When a hero suffers too much damage or fear, they are in danger of being defeated.

22.2 Each hero has a damage limit and a fear limit presented on their hero card. These limits represent the amount of damage (icon of 3 scratch claws) or fear (icon of a devil-like face with two curved horns) a hero can have before they must perform a last stand (see "Last Stands" on page 18).

- Some game effects may increase or decrease these limits. Multiple effects that increase or decrease these limits are cumulative.

*Example: If a hero has two abilities that increase their fear limit by one, that hero's fear limit is increased by two.*

22.3 To suffer a damage (icon of 3 scratch claws) or fear (icon of devil-like face with two curved horns), a hero reveals the top card of either the damage or fear deck, as appropriate, and resolves its ability. The ability instructs the hero to discard the card or to place it either faceup or facedown in their play area.

- When suffering multiple damage (icon of 3 scratch claws) and fear (icon of devil-face with two curved horns) from a single source—an enemy group or game effect—the hero suffers each damage and fear **one at a time**, revealing and resolving one card completely before revealing and resolving the next card.

- If a game effect specifically instructs a hero to suffer a number of "facedown damage" or "facedown fear," that hero takes the top card from the appropriate deck and places it in their play area **without** revealing or resolving the card's ability.

22.4 A hero cannot look at the front of a facedown damage or fear card in their play area unless a game effect specifically allows it.

22.5 After a hero suffers damage (icon of 3 scratch claws) or fear (icon of devil-like face with two curved horns), if a hero has a number of damage cards equal to or greater than their damage limit or a number of fear cards equal to or greater than their fear limit, they must perform a last stand.

- When suffering multiple damage (icon of 3 scratch claws) or fear (icon of devil-like face with two curved horns) from a single source—an enemy group or game effect—the hero does not determine if their damage or fear is equal to or greater than their damage and fear limits until all the damage or fear cards from that source are resolved completely.

22.6 Damage or fear cards that remain faceup in a hero's play area have abilities that are persistent and negatively affect the hero while the cards remain in their play area.

22.7 Some game effects allow a hero to discard damage (icon of 3 scratch claws) or fear (icon of devil-like face with two curved horns). When a hero discards a damage or fear card, they may discard a faceup card of their choice or a random facedown card.

- When a hero discards a damage (icon of 3 scratch claws) or fear (icon of devil-like face with two curved horn), they take a damage or fear card from their play area and place it at the bottom of the damage or fear deck, as appropriate.

- If a game effect allows a hero to discard multiple damage (icon of 3 scratch claws) or fear (icon of devil-like face with two curved horns), they can discard a combination of faceup and facedown damage or fear.

- Facedown damage (icon of 3 scratch claws) or fear (icon of devil-like face with two curved horn) is always discarded randomly.

22.8 When a game effect instructs a hero to flip one or more damage (icon of 3 scratch claws) or fear (icon of devil-like face with two curved horns) faceup, that hero selects those cards at random from among all of their facedown damage or fear cards.

#### 22.9   NEGATING DAMAGE AND FEAR (page 11)

Sometimes a hero can attempt to negate damage (icon of 3 scratch claws) or fear (icon of devil-like face with two curved horns) before they suffer it. This typically occurs during an enemy attack or during the darkness step of the shadow phase.

22.10 When a hero has an opportunity to negate damage (icon of 3 scratch claws) or fear (icon of devil-like face with two curved horns), the app provides the hero with a stat followed by the word "negates" (e.g., (icon of a 3-pointed spiral) negates).

22.11 To negate damage (icon of 3 scratch claws) and fear (icon of devil-like face with two curved horns), the hero performs a test of the specified stat and may prevent one damage or fear for each success (a sunburst symbol) icon that the test produces.

- Heroes do not suffer damage (icon of 3 scratch claws) or fear (icon of devil-like face with two curved horns) that is prevented the damage or fear cards are not revealed.

- If a hero would suffer both damage (icon of 3 scratch claws) and fear (icon of devil-like face with two curved horns) at the same time, the hero can choose whether each success (a sunburst symbol) icon negates either one damage or one fear.

- If a hero wishes to suffer an amount of damage (icon of 3 scratch claws) or fear (icon of devil-like face with two curved horns) even if they have enough success (a sunburst symbol) icons to negate it, they may choose to do so.

22.12 Abilities that explicitly use the word "prevent" always reduce damage (icon of 3 scratch claws) or fear (icon of devil-like face with two curved horns) without the hero needing to perform a test.

22.13 If a hero can both prevent and negate damage (icon of 3 scratch claws) or fear (icon of devil-like face with two curved horns), they may negate the damage and fear first and then resolve abilities that prevent the damage and fear.

### 23  DARKNESS (page 11)

Darkness is a property of some spaces on the map and it can cause heroes to suffer fear (icon of devil-like face with two curved horns) during the shadow phase.

23.1 Some spaces on the map have a darkness icon printed on them. These spaces are always in darkness.

23.2 Game effects can add darkness to specific spaces on the map. When this happens, a darkness token is placed on that space to represent that the space is in darkness.

23.3 The app may indicate that the entire game map is in darkness. When this happens, there is a darkness icon on the screen in the app to indicate that all the spaces on the map are in darkness—it is not necessary to place a darkness token on each space of the game map.

23.4 During the darkness step of the shadow phase, each hero that is in darkness suffers an amount of fear (icon of devil-like face with two curved horns) indicated by the app.

- A hero is in darkness if that hero is in a space that contains either a darkness icon or a darkness token.

- Typically, a hero has an opportunity to negate this fear (icon of devil-like face with two curved horns).

### 24  DEFEATED (page 12)

A hero is defeated when they fail a last stand, which occurs when that hero has suffered too much damage (icon of 3 scratch claws) or fear (icon of devil-like face with two curved horns). An enemy is defeated when its health is reduced to zero.

24.1 After a hero fails a last stand, the app informs the hero that they are defeated.

24.2 When a hero is defeated, their figure is removed from the map and they can no longer participate in the adventure.

- Any damage cards, fear cards, and tokens that are in the hero's play area remain there until the adventure is complete.

- Defeated heroes still gain experience and can participate in the next adventure as normal.

24.3 After a hero is defeated, at the beginning of the next shadow phase, the adventure automatically ends and the heroes lose.

- It is possible for the heroes to win the adventure, but they must do so before the next shadow phase begins.

24.4 After applying hits to an enemy group, if an enemy within the group has no health remaining, that enemy is defeated.

24.5 When an enemy is defeated, the app instructs the heroes to remove that enemy's figure from the game map.

### 25  DEPLETION TOKEN (page 12)

Depletion tokens are placed on trinkets to track the number of times that a hero can deplete that trinket to resolve its effect.

25.1 When a hero equips a trinket, they place a number of depletion tokens on that trinket equal to the number in the lower-left corner of the card that is presented near the depletion icon.

25.2 If a game effect instructs a hero to deplete a trinket, they remove one depletion token from that trinket.

- When a trinket has no remaining depletion tokens, it cannot be used; the hero flips the trinket facedown as a reminder that it has been fully depleted.

  - A hero cannot resolve passive abilities or abilities that do not require the depletion of the trinket while that trinket is facedown.

25.3 If a game effect allows a hero to place a depletion token on a trinket, they can place that token on a facedown trinket. When this happens, the trinket is flipped faceup and a hero can resolve abilities on that trinket.

### 26  DIFFICULTY (page 12)

There are two difficulty settings for *Journeys in Middle-earth*: normal and hard.

26.1 Players select a difficulty setting when they are setting up their first adventure of a campaign.

- Difficulty cannot be changed during a campaign.

26.2 The hard difficulty setting alters the game in the following ways:

- There are more enemies and those enemies have more abilities.

 Heroes do not gain inspiration tokens when they explore an unexplored map tile.

### 27 DISCARDING (page 12)

When components are discarded, they are placed in a specific place depending on which component it is, as follows:

27.1 Damage and fear cards are discarded to the bottom of their respective decks.

27.2 Skill cards, including weaknesses, are discarded to the skill card discard pile of the hero to whom the skill cards belong.

- If a game effect instructs a hero to remove a weakness card from the game, that card is shuffled into the weakness deck.

- If an ability instructs a hero to remove a card from the adventure, that card should be set aside and cannot be used again during that adventure.

27.3 Tokens and boon cards are discarded to their respective supply piles.

### 28  ELITE ENEMIES (page 12)

Elite enemies are stronger, more menacing versions of an enemy type.

28.1 Each elite enemy group has one or more bonuses.

- An elite enemy group's bonuses are displayed at the top of its enemy menu in the app, and a description of each bonus is displayed when that bonus is selected in the app.

- Enemy bonuses are automatically applied by the app—the description of a bonus simply informs the heroes how an elite enemy is different from a standard enemy of that type.

28.2 Elite enemy groups can counterattack heroes even if the enemy group is exhausted.

28.3 Each elite enemy group in the app has a spiked frame around its portrait to indicate that the enemy group is elite.

28.4 When placing an elite enemy group on the game map, an elite enemy banner (in a plastic stand) is also placed on the map in the same space as the elite enemy group.

- The elite enemy banner should match the color and symbol of the icon presented on that enemy group's portrait in the app.

- If the enemy group moves to a new space, its elite enemy banner is moved with it.

### 29  ENDING AN ADVENTURE OR CAMPAIGN (page 13)

An adventure ends when the party completes or fails its objectives, when threat reaches the end of the threat bar, or at the start of the shadow phase after a hero has been defeated.

A campaign can end in one of many ways, in either victory or defeat; this happens when the heroes win or lose certain adventures.

29.1 Each adventure has a series objective for the heroes to complete to win the adventure.

29.2 If the heroes complete all of an adventure's objectives, the app indicates that the adventure is over and that the heroes have won.

29.3 Some objectives can end the adventure if the heroes fail to complete them. When this happens, the app indicates that the adventure is over and that the heroes have lost.

29.4 When the threat bar in the app becomes completely filled, the app indicates that the adventure is over and that the heroes have lost.

29.5 After a hero is defeated, the adventure automatically ends at the start of the next shadow phase. If this happens, the app indicates that the adventure is over and that the heroes have lost.

- The heroes can still complete the adventure's objectives and win that adventure after a hero is defeated if they do so before the start of the next shadow phase.

29.6 After the adventure ends, whether or not the heroes win or lose, the app provides the heroes with an adventure epilogue and then proceeds to the camp screen where heroes can buy skills and upgrade items prior to beginning the next adventure of the campaign.

- If the adventure ends the campaign, the app provides the heroes with a campaign epilogue.

### 30  ENEMY ACTIVATION (page 13)

During the shadow phase, each readied enemy group activates.

30.1 When an enemy activates, the app automatically chooses a readied enemy and highlights its portrait on the enemy bar. Then, the app provides a prompt that includes instructions for that enemy group's activation.

30.2 If an enemy's instructions include "Move," followed by a number, that enemy can move a maximum number of times equal to that number toward the indicated target during the activation.

- When an enemy's instructions includes a move value and an attack target (e.g., "Move 2: Attack Aragorn"), the target of the attack is also the target of the move.

- If the move instruction provides no target, the enemy moves toward the target of its attack and stops moving when it is in range.

30.3 When an enemy group moves toward a target, each space that the enemy group moves into must reduce the distance (the number of spaces) between that enemy group and the space containing its target.

30.4 If multiple paths to get into range of the target hero are tied for being the shortest paths, the party chooses which of the paths the enemy group moves along.

30.5 If an enemy group cannot get into range of the target of its attack but can get into range of the hero that it is closest to, the enemy group targets that hero instead.

- If multiple heroes are tied for being closest to the enemy group, the heroes choose which of the tied heroes the enemy group targets.

30.6 If an enemy group can neither get into range of its target nor the hero it is closest to, the enemy group does not resolve any of its current instructions, and the hero selects "No Target" in the app. Then, the app provides the hero with additional instructions for how to move the enemy group.

- After following any additional instructions that the app provides, the enemy group's activation ends.

30.7 If an enemy group moves across a border that is covered by a stream token to get into range of a hero, the enemy group's activation ends immediately. When this happens, the "Cross Stream" button in the app is selected.

30.8 When all enemy groups are exhausted, the shadow phase proceeds to the darkness step.

### 31  ENEMY BANNERS (page 13)

Enemy banners are used to distinguish elite enemy groups and multiple enemy groups of the same type.

31.1 When placing an elite enemy group on the game map, an elite enemy banner (in a plastic stand) is also placed on the map in the same space as the elite enemy group.

31.2 When placing an enemy group on the game map that is the same type as another enemy group that is already on the game map, an enemy banner (in a plastic stand) is also placed on the map in the same space as the enemy group.

31.3 When placing an enemy banner on the map, the banner must match the color (elite or standard) and symbol of the icon presented on the enemy group's portrait in the app—the app automatically generates an icon when this is necessary.

- The color and symbol of the banner that must be placed on the map is also displayed at the top of the prompt that instructs the players to place an enemy group.

31.4 If the enemy group that is accompanied by an enemy banner moves to a new space, its enemy banner is moved with it. If an enemy group is removed from the map, its banner is also removed.

### 32  ENEMY BAR (page 13)

The enemy bar is presented in the app along the bottom of the screen.

32.1 The enemy bar contains an enemy portrait for each enemy group that is currently on the map.

32.2 If an enemy group is elite or if there are multiple enemy groups of the same type, a banner icon appears near that enemy group's portrait. This icon indicates which enemy banner the heroes place on the game map along with that enemy group.

32.3 If an enemy group can perform ranged attacks, that enemy group's portrait has a ranged (icon of a right-pointed dart with a white shaped right-pointed arrow in it) icon.

32.4 The leftmost button on the enemy bar is the provoke button. If a hero needs to provoke an enemy, they select the provoke button and then they select the portrait of the enemy group they are provoking. Then, the app provides the information required for the hero to resolve an attack from that enemy group.

32.5 By selecting an enemy portrait in the app, a hero can access that enemy group's menu.

32.6 If an enemy group is exhausted, that group's portrait is darkened.

32.7 When an enemy is activated during the shadow phase, its portrait is highlighted.

### 33  ENEMY GROUP (page 14)

An enemy group is represented on the game map by one or more plastic figures and it is represented digitally in the app by a portrait and an enemy menu.

33.1 An enemy group always moves, activates, and attacks together.

33.2 Players can access an enemy group's menu by selecting that enemy group's portrait in the app (see the appendix on page 28).

33.3 Each enemy menu displays the name of the enemy group, any bonuses the enemy group has, and a number of health bars equal to the number of enemies in the group.

- A brief description of each enemy bonus is available by selecting any of the bonus names.

33.4 By selecting the attack tab in the enemy menu, the attack pane opens to provide the heroes with an interface for adding and applying hits and modifiers to the enemy group.

33.5 If an ability or game effect refers to an "enemy," it is referencing an enemy group.

### 33  EQUIPPING ITEM (page 14)

Before starting a campaign, each hero selects their starting items and equips them. These items—or upgraded versions of these items—will remain equipped for the duration of the campaign.

34.1 At the start of an adventure, a hero can have one armor (Icon of Knight armor) card, a number of item cards that have a total of two or fewer hand icons (two (icon of left hand raised) items or one (icon of left and right hands raised together) item), and one trinket (sack of coins icon) equipped.

34.2 A hero is allowed to equip multiple trinkets if they gain one or more trinkets during an adventure.

34.3 Equipped cards are available for a hero to use during an adventure.

34.4 The items a hero should have equipped are displayed in the item menu in the app.

34.5 At the start of each adventure, each hero can equip up to one trinket from the party'S inventory.

### 35  EXHAUSTED (page 14)

Each enemy group is either readied or exhausted.

35.1 A readied enemy can activate during the shadow phase and counterattack.

35.2 When an enemy is exhausted, its portrait in the app is darkened to indicate that enemy's exhausted state.

35.3 An exhausted enemy cannot activate during the shadow phase.

35.4 An exhausted enemy cannot be provoked.

35.5 An exhausted enemy cannot counterattack unless it is an elite enemy.

35.6 The app automatically readies and exhausts enemies as required; all enemies are readied at the end of the shadow phase.

### 36  EXPERIENCE (page 14)

Experience, which is referred to as "XP" in the app, is a currency that represents a hero's training and maturity within their chosen role.

36.1 Experience is specific to each role a hero chooses to play throughout the campaign, and it is automatically tracked in the app.

- If a hero changes their role during a campaign, it is possible for them to have experience in multiple roles.

- Each hero's experience is displayed below their portrait in the camp screen. If a hero selects their portrait, they can see the amount of experience they have for each role they have played.

36.2 The app informs the heroes when they have gained experience, which typically occurs at the end of an adventure.

- The experience a hero gains at the end of an adventure is always specific to that hero and the role that the hero chose for that adventure.

#### 36.3   PURCHASING AND SELLING SKILL CARDS (page 14)

While at the camp screen between adventures, a hero can spend experience they have gained to purchase skill cards and sell skills that they have previously purchased to gain experience.

36.4 Each skill card that can be purchased or sold has an experience value presented in the lower-left corner of the card.

- This experience value indicates how much experience a hero must spend to purchase that skill card and how much experience a hero gains by selling that skill card.

36.5 From the camp screen, a hero can select their hero's portrait and any roles they have chosen to play throughout the campaign to see a list that contains all the skill cards that correspond to their selected role.

- Any skill cards that are part of that hero's skill deck are colored green.

- Any Skill Cards That The Hero Cannot Purchase Are Colored Red.

  - If a value is displayed, the hero does not have enough experience to purchase that skill card.

  - If an image of another hero is displayed, the depicted hero currently has that skill card.

- Any skill card that is not colored red or green is available for that hero to purchase.

36.6 To purchase a skill card, a hero selects it from the skill card list in the app. Then, that hero adds the physical version of that skill card to their skill deck.

- A hero can only spend experience from a role to purchase a skill card that matches that role.

- The experience a hero spends is automatically deducted in the app.

36.7 To sell a skill card, a hero selects a card that is colored green from the list in the app. Then, that hero removes the physical version of that skill card from their skill deck.

- When selling a skill card, a hero gains experience for the role that corresponds to the skill card that was sold.

- The experience a hero gains is automatically added in the app.

36.8 A hero can purchase and sell as many skill cards as they wish from any of the roles they have chosen to play each time they are at the camp screen between adventures.

### 37  EXPLORATION (page 15)

Each journey map tile has a square box where an exploration token can be placed when the tile is initially revealed in the app. This token indicates that the tile is unexplored.

> Image of a token which looks a circle with a star in the middle on a green background

37.1 After revealing and placing a new journey map tile, an exploration token is placed in the square box on that map tile if instructed by the app.

37.2 A map tile that has an exploration token is unexplored.

37.3 If a hero moves into a space on an unexplored tile, that hero must immediately explore it.

- Exploring a tile is not an action.

37.4 To explore a tile, the hero selects the exploration token in the app that corresponds to the exploration token on the map tile being explored. Then, the hero selects "Confirm" and follows the instructions in the app.

37.5 Exploring a tile does not require that the hero ends their movement in a space in that tile.

### 38  FATE (page 15)

38 Fate (leaf icon) icons appear on the upper-left corner of skill cards, and heroes use them when they are performing tests. Fate (leaf icon) icons can also appear in abilities and in the app.

38.1 Unlike success (a sunburst symbol) icons, fate (leaf) icons have no inherent effect. However, during a test, a hero can spend any number of their inspiration tokens. For each inspiration token they spend, they can convert one fate (leaf icon) icon on their revealed skill cards to one success (a sunburst symbol) icon.

- After a fate (leaf icon) icon is converted to a success (a sunburst symbol) icon, the fate (leaf icon) icon cannot be used for any other purpose and is no longer treated as a fate (leaf icon) icon.

38.2 During a test, some game effects allow heroes to use or spend fate (leaf icon) icons on revealed cards in unique ways.

- When a hero spends a fate (leaf icon) icon, that icon cannot be spent again during that test. It is important that a hero tracks which fate (leaf icon) icons they spend.

38.3 When a skill card is prepared, any fate (leaf icon) icons on that card have no effect and are ignored.

### 39  FEAR (page 15)

See "Damage and Fear" on page 11.

### 40  FIRE PIT (TERRAIN) (page 15)

A fire pit is a type of terrain that can be placed on the battle map.

> Image of molten fire in a circular form

40.1 When resolving an attack, if a hero is in a space with a fire pit token, that hero can discard one card that has a fate (leaf icon) icon that was revealed during that attack test to apply either "pierce" or "smite" to the enemy group that is being attacked.

- If a skill card is discarded because of the effect of a fire pit token, any icons on that card, such as fate (leaf icon) or success (a sunburst symbol) icons, cannot be converted or spent during that test.

### 41  GAME MAP (page 15)

The game map is the general term for the physical components that are representing Middle-earth during an adventure.

41.1 If a rule or game effect refers to the "journey map," it is referring specifically to a map that consists of journey map tiles—this is the type of map used during most adventures.

41.2 If a rule or game effect refers to the "battle map," it is referring specifically to a map that consists of battle map tiles—this type of map is used during specific adventures that focus on tactical combat.

41.3 If rule or game effect refers to the "game map" or the "map," it is generically referring to all maps—both the journey map and battle map.

### 42  GAME ROUND (page 15) 

See "Round" On Page 22.

### 43  GUARD X (KEYWORD) (page 16) 

Guard is a keyword that allows a hero to prevent damage (icon of 3 scratch claws) or fear (icon of devil-like face with two curved horns).

43.1 Any hero that is in the same space as a hero who would suffer damage (icon of 3 scratch claws) or fear (icon of devil-like face with two curved horns) can discard a card that has the "Guard X" keyword to prevent an amount of that damage and fear equal to X.

- A hero must choose to use the "Guard X" keyword before damage and fear cards are revealed.

- A hero can use the "Guard X" keyword to prevent damage (icon of 3 scratch claws) and fear (icon of devil-like face with two curved horns) to themselves.

- A hero can prevent any combination of damage (icon of 3 scratch claws) and fear (icon of devil-like face with two curved horns) that is equal to or less than X.

43.2 A hero can only discard a card to use the "Guard X" keyword if that card is prepared.

43.3 Multiple abilities that have the "Guard X" keyword can be used to prevent damage (icon of 3 scratch claws) and fear (icon of devil-like face with two curved horns) from a single source. Multiple heroes can use abilities with the "Guard X" keyword to prevent damage and fear from the same source.

- If multiple heroes suffer damage (icon of 3 scratch claws) and fear (icon of devil-like face with two curved horns) while they are in the same space, a single ability that has the "Guard X" keyword can only prevent the damage and fear suffered by one of those heroes.

### 44  HERO (page 16) 

Each player controls a hero of Middle-earth.

44.1 Each hero is represented on the game map by a plastic figure.

44.2 Each hero has a play area that includes their hero card, their equipped items, and their unique skill deck.

44.3 When playing single-player, that player controls two heroes.

### 45  HERO CARDS (page 16)

Each hero has a hero card that displays information about that hero.

45.1 Each hero card displays that hero's values for each of the five stats.

- A stat's corresponding value indicates how many skill cards a hero reveals when performing a test of that stat.

45.2 Each hero card displays that hero's damage and fear limits.

- If a hero ever has a number of damage cards in their play area equal to or exceeding their damage limit or a number of fear cards in their play area equal to or exceeding their fear limit, that hero must perform a last stand.

45.3 Each hero card displays that hero's unique hero abilities. Each hero ability describes when it can be used and how its effect is resolved.

45.4 A hero places their prepared cards below their hero card.

### 46  HIDE (KEYWORD) (page 16)

Hide is a keyword that allows a hero to gain a "Hidden" boon card.

46.1 After a hero performs any test, they may discard a card that has the "Hide" keyword to gain a "Hidden" boon card.

46.2 A hero can only discard a card to use the "Hide" keyword if that card is prepared.

46.3 A hero cannot use the "Hide" keyword if they are hidden.

### 47  HITTING ENEMIES (page 16)

See "Applying Hits to Enemies" on page 8.

### 48  INSPIRATION (page 16)

48 Inspiration tokens allow heroes to convert fate (leaf icon) icons to success (a sunburst symbol) icons during tests. (image of a glowing white leaf on a gree background)

48.1 When a hero gains an inspiration token, they place the token on their hero card.

48.2 Each hero card has an inspiration limit, which indicates the maximum number of inspiration tokens they can have at a time.

- If a hero gains inspiration but already has inspiration equal to their limit, they cannot gain that inspiration.

48.3 During a test, a hero can spend any number of their inspiration tokens. For each inspiration token they spend, they can convert one fate (leaf icon) icon on their revealed skill cards to one success (a sunburst symbol) icon.

48.4 To spend an inspiration token, a hero takes one inspiration token from their hero card and places it in the supply.

### 49  INTERACT ACTION (page 16)

The interact action allows heroes to encounter points of interest on the map.

49.1 If a hero is in the same space as a search, person, threat, or certain terrain token, they can interact with that token by performing an interact action.

49.2 To perform an interact action, a hero selects the token in the app that they wish to interact with. When a prompt appears, the hero selects a button that has the interact (2 right-pointer arrow icon) icon. Then, the hero follows the instructions that the app provides.

- Buttons that have the interact (2 right-pointer arrow icon) icon **cannot and should not** be selected outside of a hero performing an interact action—it often has irreversible impacts on the adventure.

- If a hero selects the incorrect token in the app or decides not to perform an interact action, they select the button **without** an interact (2 right-pointer arrow icon) icon when the prompt appears.

49.3 If a hero wishes to perform an interact action while in a space that contains one or more enemy groups, before that hero performs that action, they must provoke each enemy group in that space in the order of their choice.

- After provoking each enemy group, the hero can perform an interact action.

- A Hero Must Provoke Each Enemy Group In Their Space For Each interact action they wish to perform.

*Example: If a hero is in a space with a person token, a search token, and an enemy group, they must provoke that enemy group before interacting with the person token and again before interacting with the search token.*

- Enemies are provoked in this way if the hero is interacting with a component in that space either through an interact action or because of a game effect that allows them to do so.

49.4 Heroes may be able to perform interact actions to resolve specific effects provided by terrain tokens.

- This counts as one of the actions a hero can perform during their Turn.

### 50  INVENTORY (page 17)

The inventory refers to the party's items and any skills they have purchased.

50.1 To view the items that are in the inventory, a hero selects the "item" button in the app.

- Each hero's starting items or upgraded items are listed in the "Hero" tab of the item menu.

- The party's trinkets are listed in the "Trinkets" tab of the item menu.

50.2 To view the skills (including titles) that a hero has in their inventory, they select their portrait on the camp screen.

- Each of a hero's purchased skills are organized by role and are colored green.

50.3 If a game effect instructs a hero to equip a trinket from the inventory, they can equip any trinket from the "Trinket" tab that is not already in play.

50.4 Some abilities on title skill cards instruct a hero to remove the card from the adventure. When this happens, the hero sets the card aside and cannot use it for the duration of the adventure.

50.5 When continuing a campaign, players gather the item and skill cards in their inventory from the game box.

### 51  ITEMS CARDS (page 17)

Item cards represent the weapons, armor, trinkets, instruments, and other equipment that the heroes use during their adventure.

51.1 Item cards have unique abilities for heroes to use at various times during a game.

- Most abilities describe when they can be used and how their effects are resolved.

- Abilities that are prefaced by a numeral and success (a sunburst symbol) icon, can only be used by spending success (a sunburst symbol) icons during an attack test.

51.2 Items that can be used during an attack test contain one or more stats in the upper-left corner of the card.

51.3 Each item type is represented by one of the following icons:

- (icon of knight armor) Armor

- (icon of left hand raised) One-Handed

- (icon of both right and left hands raised together) Two-Handed

- (sack of coins icon) Trinket

51.4 A hero can equip up to one armor (icon of knight armor) card, a number of item cards that have a total of two or fewer hand icons (two (icon of left hand raised ) items or one (icon of both right and left hands raised together) item), and one trinket (sack of coins icon).

- A hero is allowed to equip multiple trinkets if they gain one or more trinkets during an adventure.

51.5 Each item card has a lore value presented in the lower-right corner of the card.

- This lore value indicates how much lore the party must gain before an upgrade for that item card becomes available.

51.6 Each item has a tier, represented as a roman numeral on its card. When upgrading an item, a hero always upgrades it to a card of the next higher tier.

- A hero's starting items are tier "I."

- If an item reaches the highest tier, heroes cannot upgrade that item further, even if there is a lore value printed on the card.

51.7 By selecting the "Items" button in the camp screen, the party can view all of the items in its inventory.

### 52  JOURNEY MAP (page 17)

The journey map is used during adventures that focus on exploration and travel.

52.1 The journey map consists of a procedurally generated arrangement of journey map tiles.

52.2 The fog that is depicted near the edges of tiles in the app indicates to heroes where new map tiles will be placed.

### 53  KEYWORDS (page 18)

Keywords are shorthand for specific abilities that appear frequently on cards.

53.1 Each keyword has specific rules that players can reference in that keyword's glossary entry. The keywords are:

- Scout X

- Strike X

- Guard X

- Sprint X

- Rest X

- Hide

53.2 If a card adds a keyword to a card and that card already has that keyword, the card is treated as having the better version of that keyword.

*Example: If a skill card has "Strike 2" and that card gains "Strike 1" through a game effect, that card is treated as having the "Strike 2" keyword.*

### 54 LAST STANDS (page 18)

A last stand is a test that determines whether or not a hero who has exceeded their damage or fear limit is defeated.

54.1 After a hero suffers damage (icon of 3 claw scratches) or fear (icon of devil-like face with two curved horns), if a hero has a number of damage cards equal to or greater than their damage limit or a number of fear cards equal to or greater than their fear limit, they must perform a last stand.

- When suffering multiple damage (icon of 3 claw scratches) or fear (icon of devil-like face with two curved horns) from a single source—an enemy group or game effect—the hero does not determine if their damage or fear is equal to or greater than their damage and fear limits until all the damage or fear cards from that source are resolved completely.

54.2 To begin a last stand, the hero selects the party button in the lower-left corner of app and then selects the portrait of the hero that is performing the last stand.

54.3 During the last stand, the app instructs the player to select the type of last stand test to perform: a damage test or a fear test.

- If the last stand was triggered because the number of damage cards a hero has is equal to or greater than their damage limit, they must perform a damage test. If the last stand was triggered because the number of fear cards a hero has is equal to or greater than their fear limit, they must perform a fear test.

- If a hero has a number of damage cards equal to or greater than their damage limit and a number of fear cards equal to or greater than their fear limit, that hero must perform two successive last stands—one for damage (icon of 3 claw scratches) and one for fear (icon of devil-like face with two curved horns). The hero can choose the order in which they perform these last stands.

54.4 After resolving the test for the last stand, the app provides the hero with additional instructions.

### 55  LETHAL (page 18) 

See "Modifiers" On Page 19.

### 56  LORE (page 18)

56 Lore (icon with a circle with a 4-sided star in it) is a representation of the knowledge that the heroes have obtained throughout the campaign.

56.1 The app informs the heroes when they have gained lore—this can occur during an adventure or at the end of an adventure.

56.2 Heroes share their lore as a party, and it is automatically tracked in the app.

- The party's lore value is displayed in the lower-left corner of the camp screen between adventures.

- The party's lore value is displayed in the party menu during an adventure.

56.3 The party cannot lose lore; it can only be gained. Lore is not spent when a hero upgrades an item.

56.4 As the party's lore value increases, new item upgrades become available.

- Each item card has a lore value presented in the lower-right corner of the card that indicates how much lore the party must gain before an upgrade for that item card becomes available.

- A hero cannot upgrade their item until they are at the camp screen between adventures.

#### 56.5 UPGRADING ITEMS (page 18)

While at the camp screen between adventures, a hero can upgrade their items.

56.6 If an item can be upgraded, that item is highlighted in the item menu. If a highlighted item in the menu is selected, the app provides a list of available upgrades for that item.

56.7 To upgrade an item, a hero selects a highlighted item from the item menu in the app and then selects one of the available upgrades. Then, the hero discards the item card that was upgraded and replaces it with the upgraded version that matches the one they selected in the app.

- The discarded upgrade card is returned to the supply and is no longer in the hero'S inventory.

- After confirming the upgrade, the app automatically removes the upgraded item from the inventory and replaces it with the upgraded version.

56.8 A hero can upgrade as many items as they wish while they are at the camp screen between adventures.

### 57  LOSING AN ADVENTURE OR CAMPAIGN (page 18)

See "Ending an Adventure or Campaign" on page 13.

### 58  MIST (TERRAIN) (page 19)

Mist is a type of terrain that can be placed on the battle map.

58.1 If a hero would suffer damage (icon of 3 claw scratches) while in a space that has a mist token, any damage that the hero suffers is suffered facedown. (image of a white-brown wood plank)

58.2 When resolving an attack that targets an enemy group that is in a space that has a mist token, during the attack test, the hero cannot convert fate (leaf icon) icons to success (a sunburst symbol) icons by spending inspiration or by resolving any other game effect that allows such a conversion.

### 59  MODIFIERS (page 19) 

There are six attack modifiers that can change how hits are applied to enemy groups.

59.1 When attacking an enemy group, a hero can resolve abilities on their item cards that add hits or modifiers to that enemy group.

- Other game effects and abilities can also allow a hero to apply modifiers to an enemy group.

59.2 Multiple modifiers can be applied to the same attack and all of their effects combine.

59.3 Some enemy abilities prohibit the application of certain modifiers. If an ability would apply a prohibited modifier, the modifier has no effect.

59.4 Modifiers can be selected and unselected to view their effectsbefore selecting "Confirm" to resolve an attack.

59.5 The same modifier cannot be applied multiple times during a single attack.

59.6 The six modifiers and their effects are as follows:

- **Pierce:** Hits ignore an enemy group's armor when they are applied in conjunction with the "pierce" modifier.

- **Smite:** Hits ignore an enemy group's sorcery when they are applied in conjunction with the "smite" modifier.

- **Cleave:** Hits are applied to all enemies in an enemy group when they are applied in conjunction with the "cleave" modifier.

- **Lethal:** If an enemy's remaining health (not armor or sorcery) is halved during an attack and the "lethal" modifier is applied, that enemy is defeated.

- **Sunder:** The "sunder" modifier permanently decreases an enemy's armor by one. If an enemy is defeated, the armor of another enemy in the group is also reduced by one.

- **Stun:** If the "stun" modifier is applied to an enemy group, that enemy group is exhausted, and if the enemy group is elite, it cannot counterattack.

59.7 The rules for applying modifiers can be found in the "Applying hits to enemies" section on page 8.

### 60  MOVEMENT (page 19) 

This entry contains separate sections for how to resolve hero and enemy movement.

#### 60.1 HERO MOVEMENT (page 19)

The primary way that a hero moves around the map is by performing a travel action during their turn.

60.2 To move, a hero moves their figure from the space it currently occupies to an adjacent space.

60.3 If a hero moves into any space of an unexplored tile, that hero must explore that tile.

- Exploring a tile is not optional; it occurs immediately and is not an action.

60.4 If a hero wishes to move out of a space that contains one or more readied enemy groups, before that hero moves, they must provoke each readied enemy group in that space.

- After provoking each enemy group, the hero can move to an adjacent space.

- Enemy groups are provoked in this way if the hero moves either because of a travel action or a game effect that causes or allows them to move.

60.5 If a game effect instructs a hero figure to be "placed" on the game map, that placement is **not** a move for purposes of game rules and interactions of game effects.

- If a hero is placed in a space from another space that contains one or more enemy groups, those enemy groups are **not** provoked.

#### 60.6 ENEMY MOVEMENT (page 19)

Enemy groups move during their activation. Typically, they move toward a specific hero to resolve an attack against them.

60.7 Each time an enemy group moves, its figures are moved from the space they currently occupy to an adjacent space.

60.8 When an enemy group moves, the app indicates the maximum number of times an enemy group can move and provides a target that the enemy moves toward.

60.9 During its activation, if an enemy group moves across a border that is covered by a stream token, that enemy group's activation ends immediately.

### 61  NEARBY (page 19) 

Some rules and game effects refer to nearby components or spaces.

61.1 A component is nearby another component if they are in the same space or are in spaces that are adjacent to each other on the game map.

61.2 A component is **not** nearby itself.

### 62  NEGATING DAMAGE AND FEAR (page 19)

See "Damage And Fear" On Page 11.

### 63  OBJECTIVES (page 20) 

Each adventure provides the heroes with a series of objectives.

63.1 The heroes' current objective is displayed beneath the threat bar in the app.

63.2 After the heroes complete their current objective, the app provides the heroes with a new objective automatically.

63.3 If the heroes complete all of an adventure's objectives, the adventure ends, the heroes win the game, and the app proceeds to the camp screen prior to beginning the next adventure of the campaign.

### 64  PARTY (page 20)

The party is the collective term for all the heroes playing a game.

64.1 If a rule or game effect uses the word "party" is it is referring to each hero playing the game.

64.2 Before beginning a campaign, the players create a name for their party which is displayed in their save slot.

### 65  PERSON TOKENS (page 20)

A person token may appear on the map and represents a person with whom the heroes can interact. (image of a circular portrait of a woman in head scarf)

65.1 By selecting a person token in the app, a hero can obtain information about that person token.

65.2 If a hero is in the same space as a person token, they can interact with that token by performing an interact action (see "Interact Action" on page 16).

65.3 Any hero can select a person token in the app at any time; however, they can only select a button that has an interact (icon of 2 right-pointed arrows) icon if they are performing an interact action.

### 66  PIERCE (page 20) 

See "Modifiers" On Page 19.

### 67  PIT (TERRAIN) (page 20)

A pit is a type of terrain that can be placed on the battle map. (Image of a hole with stone concrete for the edges with a black color in the middle signifying the pit or hole itself)

67.1 If a hero moves into a space with a pit token, that hero must perform an agility (icon of a 3-pointed spiral) test.

- If the test produces at least two success (a sunburst symbol) icons, the hero passes the test and nothing happens.

- If the test produces fewer than two success (a sunburst symbol) results, the hero fails the test and suffers two damage (icon of a 3 claw scratch).

67.2 A hero must perform an agility (icon of a 3-pointed spiral) test when they move into a space that has a pit token even if that hero is moving through that space—the pit token affects a hero even if that hero is not ending their movement in that space.

67.3 If a game effect "places" a hero in a space that has a pit token, that hero ignores the effects of that pit token.

### 68  PLAY AREA (page 20)

Each hero has a play area where their game components are placed.

68.1 A hero's play area always consists of their hero card, equipped items, and skill deck as well as other components that are added or removed during play, such as damage and fear cards.

68.2 When a hero suffers damage (icon of a 3 claw scratch) and fear (icon of a devil-like face with two curved horns), they place damage and fear cards in their play area.

68.3 When a hero gains a boon card, they place it in their play area.

### 69  PREPARING CARDS (page 20)

Heroes can prepare their skill cards to use the abilities on those cards.

69.1 To prepare a skill a card, a hero places it below their hero card.

69.2 The most common way for a hero to prepare a skill card is to resolve an ability that allows that hero to scout.

- During most adventures, the app prompts each hero to scout before the first action phase and during each rally phase.

69.3 During setup, each hero prepares the "1" card that corresponds to their chosen role.

- This card has stars on each side of the card's name.

- This card is prepared during the setup steps.

69.4 A hero can have up to four prepared cards at the same time.

- After a hero prepares one or more skill cards, if that hero has more than four prepared cards, they must discard any of their prepared cards until only four cards remain prepared.

69.5 When a skill card is prepared, a hero is able to use that card's ability.

- To use a card's ability, a hero follows the instructions on the card.

- A hero cannot use an ability on a skill card if that card is not prepared.

69.6 When a skill card is prepared, any success (a sunburst symbol) and fate (leaf icon) icons on that card have no effect and are ignored.

### 70  PEVENTING DAMAGE AND FEAR (page 20)

See "Damage and Fear" on page 11.

### 71  PROVOKING ENEMIES (page 21)

When a hero is in the same space as an enemy group, certain actions that the hero performs will provoke that enemy, causing it to attack.

71.1 To provoke an enemy group, a hero selects the leftmost button on the enemy bar followed by the portrait of the enemy group they are provoking. Then, the app provides the information required for the hero to resolve an attack from that enemy group.

71.2 If a hero wishes to move out of a space that contains one or more enemy groups, before that hero moves, they must provoke each enemy group in that space.

- After provoking each enemy group, the hero can move to an adjacent space.

- Enemy groups are provoked in this way if the hero moves either because of a travel action or a game effect that causes or allows them to move.

71.3 If a hero wishes to perform an interact action while in a space that contains one or more enemy groups, before that hero performs that action, they must provoke each enemy group in that space.

- After provoking each enemy group, the hero can perform the interact action.

- A hero must provoke each enemy group in their space for each interact action they wish to perform.

*Example: If a hero is in a space with a person token, a search token, and one enemy group, they must provoke that enemy group before interacting with the person token and again before interacting with the search token.*

- Enemies are provoked in this way if the hero is interacting with a component in that space either through an interact action or because of a game effect that allows them to do so.

### 74  PURCHASING SKILLS (page 21)

See "Experience" on page 14.

### 73  RALLY PHASE (page 21)

The rally phase is the last phase of each round. During this phase, heroes plan for the next game round.

To resolve the rally phase, heroes perform the following steps in order:

73.1 **Step 1—Reset:** Each hero resets their skill deck by shuffling their discard pile into their deck.

- If a hero does not have any skill cards in their discard pile, they still shuffle their skill deck.

73.2 **Step 2—Scout:** Each hero scouts two cards by revealing two cards from the top of their skill deck. Then, they prepare up to one of those cards, placing each remaining card on the top or bottom of their skill deck in any order.

### 74  RANGE (page 21)

Range refers to the distance between a hero and enemy when one of them is resolving an attack.

74.1 A hero can only resolve an attack against an enemy group that is in range, and an enemy can only resolve an attack against a hero that is in range.

74.2 A hero and enemy group are in range of each other if they occupy the same space.

74.3 A ranged attack is an attack in which the range between a hero and an enemy group is extended.

- During an adventure on a journey map, a hero and enemy group are in range of each other if they occupy the same space or if they are in spaces adjacent to each other.

74.4 Heroes and enemy groups that can perform ranged attacks are identified in different ways, as follows:

- If an enemy group can resolve ranged attacks, that enemy group's portrait contains a ranged (icon of a right-pointed dart with a white shaped right-pointed arrow in it) icon.

- If an item allows a hero to resolve ranged attacks, that item has a ranged (icon of a right-pointed dart with a white shaped right-pointed arrown in it) icon in the upper-right corner of the card.

### 75  READIED (page 21)

See "Exhausted" on page 14.

### 76  RESET (page 21)

If a game effect instructs a hero to reset their skill deck, they shuffle their skill discard pile into their skill deck. If a hero does not have any skill cards in their discard pile, they still shuffle their skill deck.

76.1 If no cards remain in a hero's skill deck, that hero shuffles their skill deck discard pile to create a new skill deck.

### 77  REST X (KEYWORD) (page 21)

Rest is a keyword that allows a hero to discard facedown damage (icon of a 3 claw scratch) or fear (icon of a devil-face with two curved horns) they have already suffered.

77.1 At the end of a hero's turn during the action phase, they can discard a card that has the "Rest X" keyword to remove an amount of facedown damage or fear cards from their play area equal to X.

- A hero can discard any combination of damage (icon of a 3 claw scratch) and fear (icon of a devil-like face with two curved horns) that is equal to or less than X.

77.2 A hero may use multiple cards that have the "Rest X" keyword at the end of a single turn.

77.3 A hero can only discard a card to use the "Rest X" keyword if that card is prepared.

### 78  ROLES (page 22)

Roles define part of a hero's capabilities.

78.1 During setup before each adventure, each hero selects the role they would like to play for that adventure.

78.2 The role a hero chooses during setup determines the three role- specific skill cards (numbered 1–3) that become part of that hero's skill deck.

78.3 During setup, each hero's role-specific card that is numbered 1 is prepared.

- There are stars depicted on each side of this card's name to help a hero identify and gather this card quickly.

78.4 A hero can select a different role for each adventure. This allows a hero to gain experience in different roles, which provides a hero with additional options when purchasing skills.

- When a hero selects a new role, the role-specific cards numbered 1–3 that correspond to the previous role are removed from their skill deck; however, any role-specific cards numbered 4 or greater remain in their skill deck.

78.5 Heroes can spend experience they have earned to purchase role- specific skill cards from the camp screen between adventures.

78.6 Any skill cards a hero purchases remain part of their skill deck even if that hero selects a new role.

- This allows a hero to have role-specific skill cards (numbered 4 or greater) from multiple roles in their skill deck.

78.7 When a hero gains experience at the end of an adventure, that experience is always specific to that hero and the role that the hero chose for that adventure.

- A hero can only spend experience from a role to purchase a skill card that matches that role.

- When selling a skill card, a hero gains experience for the role that corresponds to the skill card that was sold.

### 79  ROUND (page 22)

A game round consists of the following three phases:

1. Action Phase (see page 6)

2. Shadow Phase (see page 23)

3. Rally Phase (see page 21)

### 80  SAVING AND CONTINUING (page 22)

When starting a campaign, the heroes must select a save slot. The app provides players with multiple save slots so they can have multiple campaigns in progress at the same time.

80.1 During an adventure, the app automatically saves the game at the end of each round.

- During an adventure, the players can manually save the game in the options menu, which they can access by selecting the gear button in the upper-right corner.

- Between adventures, the players can save the game by selecting the "save & quit" button in the camp screen.

80.2 Players can quit the game any time during an adventure or between adventures.

- The app does not track the positions of enemies or heroes on the map nor does it track each hero's play area or the state of their skill decks—if quitting during an adventure, players must track that information on their own or keep the game set up between sessions.

80.3 To continue a campaign, the players select the "Load Game" button from the app's main title screen. Then, they select the save slot for the game they wish to continue.

80.4 When continuing a campaign, the app will load the game at the exact moment when the save state was created.

### 81  SCOUT X (KEYWORD) (page 22)

Scout is a keyword that allows heroes to prepare and reorder cards in their skill deck.

81.1 When an effect instructs a hero to "Scout X," that hero reveals X cards from the top of their skill deck. That hero may prepare one of those cards. Then, that hero places the other revealed cards on the top or bottom of their skill deck.

- The cards placed back in the deck can all be placed on the top, all on the bottom, or split between top and bottom.

- If the hero places multiple cards on the top or bottom of the skill deck, those cards can be placed in any order.

### 82  SEARCH TOKEN (page 22)

A search token may appear on the map and represents a location or area within a space with which the heroes can interact. (image of object shaped like a circle with an inverted square with an eye in the middle)

82.1 By selecting a search token in the app, a hero can obtain information about what that specific search token represents.

82.2 If a hero is in the same space as a search token, they can interact with that token by performing an interact action (see "Interact Action" on page 16).

82.3 Any hero can select a search token in the app at any time; however, they can only select a button that has an interact (icon of 2 right-pointed arrows) icon if they are performing an interact action.

### 83  SHADOW PHASE (page 23)

The shadow phase is when enemies, darkness, and other threats attempt to hinder the party's progress.

The shadow phase contains three steps that the heroes resolve in order:

83.1 **Step 1—Enemy Activation:** Each readied enemy group activates as instructed by the app.

- When an enemy group activates, it typically moves toward a hero and attacks them.

- If there are not enemy groups present on the game map, the app automatically skips the "Enemy Activation" step.

83.2 **Step 2—Darkness:** Each hero that is in a space that contains darkness suffers an amount of fear (icon of a devil-like face with two curved horns) indicated by the app.

- If darkness is not present on the game map and if the app is not causing darkness, the app automatically skips the "Darkness" step.

83.3 **Step 3—Threat:** The threat bar increases and a threat event is resolved for each threshold that the bar meets or exceeds.

- Threat Increases During This Step By The Following Amounts:

  - Two For Each Hero In The Party

  - one for each threat token on the game map

  - one for each unexplored tile

83.4 After resolving the threat step, the app proceeds to the rally phase.

83.5 At the end of the shadow phase, all exhausted enemies are automatically readied.

### 84  SINGLE-PLAYER GAME (page 23)

If playing with only a single player, that player controls two to four heroes. All other rules of the game remain the same.

84.1 The player maintains a separate play area for each hero they control. Heroes do not share items, tokens, skill card decks, etc.

84.2 During the action phase, the player must completely resolve a hero's turn before resolving another hero's turn.

### 85  SKILL CARDS

Each hero has a deck of skill cards that represents their capabilities.

85.1 Each hero's skill deck consists of the following cards:

- One of each skill card numbered 1–6 that has the word "Basic" on the bottom of the card.

- The skill cards numbered 1–5 that have the name of their hero on the bottom of the card.

- The skill cards numbered 1–3 that have their role on the bottom of the card.

- One weakness card from the top of the weakness deck.

- Any skill cards that the hero has purchased during the campaign.

- Any title cards that the hero has gained during the campaign.

85.2  Many skill cards have unique abilities that can be resolved at various times during the game.

- A hero can only resolve an ability on one of their skill cards if that skill card is prepared.

- If a skill card is not prepared, any text abilities on that skill card are ignored.

85.3 Many skill cards contain success (a sunburst symbol) and fate (leaf icon) icons in the upper-left corner of the card.

- These icons are used when a skill card is revealed while a hero is performing a test.

85.4 Some role-specific cards have an experience value in the lower-left corner of the card.

- This value indicates how much experience (within that role) a hero must spend to purchase that skill card or how much experience a hero gains (for that role) when selling that skill card.

### 86  SMITE (page 23) 

See "Modifiers" On Page 19.

### 87  SORCERY (page 23)

Some enemy groups have sorcery, which can make them more difficult to defeat.

87.1 An enemy group's sorcery is displayed on its health bar within its enemy menu.

87.2 When a hero applies hits to an enemy that has sorcery, the hits are applied to that enemy's sorcery before they are applied to that enemy's health.

- If an enemy has both armor and sorcery, hits are applied to that enemy's armor before they are applied to that enemy's sorcery.

87.3 After a hero selects the "Apply" button to apply hits to an enemy, any enemy that was not defeated regains its sorcery.

87.4 When the "smite" modifier is selected, any hits that are applied to an enemy ignore that enemy's sorcery.

### 88  SPEND (page 23)

Heroes can spend various tokens and currencies throughout the game to purchase cards and resolve game effects.

88.1 During a test, a hero can spend any number of their inspiration tokens. For each inspiration token they spend, they can convert one fate (leaf icon) icon on their revealed skill cards to one success (a sunburst symbol) icon.

- When a hero spends an inspiration token, they take the token from their hero card and place it in the supply.

88.2 A hero can spend experience between adventures to purchase new skill cards.

- When a hero spends experience, the app automatically deducts any experience the hero spends.

88.3 When performing an attack test, a hero can spend success (a sunburst symbol) icons that the test produced to resolve abilities on the item cards being used for that test.

- When a hero spends a success (a sunburst symbol) icon, that icon cannot be spent again during that test. It is important that a hero tracks which success (a sunburst symbol) icons they spend.

88.4 When performing a test, some game effects allow heroes to spend fate (leaf icon) icons on revealed cards in unique ways.

- When a hero spends a fate (leaf icon) icon, that icon cannot be spent again during that test. It is important that a hero tracks which fate (leaf icon) icons they spend.

### 89  SPRINT X (KEYWORD) (page 24)

Sprint is a keyword that allows a hero to move extra spaces.

89.1 When a hero is taking a turn during the action phase, that hero can discard a card that has the "Sprint X" keyword to move X additional spaces.

89.2 A hero can perform other actions and resolve other game effects between each movement that is provided by the "Sprint X" keyword.

89.3 A hero can only discard a card to use the "Sprint X" keyword if that card is prepared.

### 90  STATS (page 24)

90 Each hero has five stats that represent their agility (icon of a 3-pointed spiral), might (icon of a horn), spirit (icon of a blazing fire), wisdom (icon of a tree), and wit (speed motion icon).

90.1 Each hero's stats are printed on their hero card and have a corresponding value that determines how many skill cards they reveal during a test using that stat.

- A higher stat value indicates that the hero has a greater proficiency and lower stat values represent a lower proficiency.

90.2 When performing most tests, the heroes are instructed which of their stats they must test.

- When performing an attack test, heroes can choose to test a stat from among their item cards.

90.3 Each item card that can be used during an attack test has one or more stats presented in the upper-left corner of the card. To use an ability on this type of item card, a hero must perform an attack test using one of the stats presented on that card.

*Example: If a hero wishes to attack an enemy using their "Sword" card, that hero must perform an attack test using their might (icon of a horn) stat because that is the stat presented on the "Sword" card.*

### 91  STATUE (TERRAIN) (page 24)

A statue is a type of terrain that can be placed on the battle map. (image of a oyester shell)

91.1 During the action phase, if a hero is in a space with a statue token, that hero can perform an interact action to interact with that statue.

91.2 When a hero interacts with a statue token, they perform a might (icon of a horn) Test.

- If the test produces at least two success (a sunburst symbol) icons, the hero passes the test and can choose one enemy group in their space and apply four hits and sunder to that enemy group. Then, they discard the statue token.

- If the test produces fewer than two success (a sunburst symbol) icons, the hero fails the test and nothing happens.

91.3 If a hero is in a space with one or more enemies, performing an interact action to interact with a statue does not provoke enemy attacks.

### 92  STREAM (TERRAIN) (page 24) 

A stream is a terrain token that can be placed over a border on a battle map.(image of a blue flowing water in an horizontal form)

92.1 Two spaces on opposite sides of a stream token are adjacent.

92.2 During the action phase, if a hero moves across a border that contains a stream token, that hero's turn ends immediately.

- The hero cannot perform any actions or resolve any game effects that occur during the current turn.

92.3 During the shadow phase, if an enemy moves across a border that contains a stream token, that enemy's activation ends immediately.

- If an enemy can end its movement in range of its target but must move across a border that contains a stream token to do so, that enemy still moves; however, the "Cross Stream" button is selected instead of the "Attack" button.

92.4 A hero or enemy that is performing a ranged attack can be in range of a target that is on the other side of a stream.

### 93  STRIKE X (KEYWORD) (page 24)

Strike is a keyword that allows a hero to add hits to enemies during an attack.

93.1 When a hero is performing an attack test, that hero can discard a card that has the "Strike X" keyword to add X hits to the enemy group that is the target of that attack.

93.2 A hero can only discard a card to use the "Strike" keyword if that card is prepared.

### 94  STUN (page 24) 

See "Modifiers" On Page 19

### 95  SUCCESSES (page 25)

95 Success (a sunburst symbol) icons appear on the upper-left corner of skill cards, and heroes use them when they are performing tests.

95.1 During a test, a hero reveals skill cards from their skill deck and calculates the number of success (a sunburst symbol) icons the test produced.

95.2 Depending on the type of test, success (a sunburst symbol) icons produced during the test are used in different ways (see "Tests" on page 25).

95.3 During a test, a hero can spend any number of their inspiration tokens. For each inspiration token they spend, they can convert one fate (leaf icon) icon on their revealed skill cards to one success (a sunburst symbol) icon.

  - After a fate (leaf icon) icon is converted to a success (a sunburst symbol) icon, the fate (leaf icon) icon cannot be used for any other purpose and is no longer treated as a fate (leaf icon) icon.

95.4 When a skill card is prepared, any success (a sunburst icon) icons on that card

have no effect and are ignored.

95.5 Success (a sunburst icon) icons that a test produces that are in excess of the

required number of success (a sunburst icon) icons have no effect.

### 96  SUNDER (page 25)

See "Modifiers" on page 19.

### 97  SUPPLY (page 25)

The supply refers to the collection of tokens and cards that are available for players to use during the game.

97.1 The supply consists of distinct piles for each type of token as well as separate decks for weakness cards, trinket cards, title cards, and each of the three types of boon cards.

### 98  TABLE (TERRAIN) (page 25)

A table is a type of terrain that can be placed on the battle map. (image of wodden table in a wall form)

98.1 During the action phase, if a hero is in a space with a table token, that hero can perform an interact action to interact with that table.

98.2 When a hero interacts with a table token, they perform a spirit (a blazing fire) test.

- If the test produces at least one success (a sunburst symbol) icon, the hero passes the test and gains one inspiration token and becomes emboldened.

- If the test does not produce at least one success (a sunburst symbol) icon, the hero fails the test and nothing happens.

98.3 A hero can interact with a table even if they are already emboldened, have a number of inspiration tokens equal to their limit, or both.

- A hero that is already emboldened can still gain inspiration tokens.

- A hero that has a number of inspiration tokens equal to their limit can still become emboldened.

98.4 If a hero is in a space with an enemy, performing an interact action to interact with a table does not provoke enemy attacks.

### 99  TERRAIN CARDS (page 25)

Each type of terrain has a corresponding terrain card.

99.1 A terrain card is a reference for its corresponding terrain token's abilities. The complete rules for each terrain token can be found in its individual glossary entry in this Rules Reference.

99.2 After the heroes set up a battle map, they should gather each terrain card that corresponds to one of the terrain tokens on the map and place it near the play area for all players to reference.

- A terrain token's ability can also be referenced in the app by selecting one of the terrain tokens.

99.3 Some terrain tokens have adventure-specific rules that are described by the app. If a terrain token has adventure-specific rules, the heroes should ignore the terrain card for that terrain token.

- Terrain that has adventure-specific rules is depicted with a sparkle effect in the app.

### 100 TESTS (page 25) 

Heroes perform tests throughout the game to interact with the world and attack enemies.

A test is a measure of one of a hero's stats. A hero may be instructed to perform a test of a specific stat, of one stat from a list of options, or of any stat of their choice.

To perform a test, a hero resolves the following steps in order:

100.1 **Step 1—Reveal Cards:** The hero reveals a number of cards from their skill deck equal to the value of their stat that is being tested.

- To reveal a card, a hero takes the top card from their skill deck and flips it faceup, placing it in their play area.

- A game effect can cause a hero to reveal more or fewer cards than is determined by the stat that is printed on the hero's card.

- A hero always reveals a minimum of one while performing a test, even if the number of revealed cards is modified below one.

- If there are multiple game effects that alter the number of skill cards a hero reveals, all of these effects are calculated before any cards are revealed.

- A game effect can increase or decrease a hero's stat. This may cause the hero to reveal more or fewer cards than the number that is printed on their hero card.

- A game effect can directly increase or decrease the number of skill cards a hero reveals when they are performing a test.

- The text on all revealed cards is ignored. During a test, only the success (a sunburst icon) and fate (leaf icon) icons in the upper-left corner of the revealed cards are relevant.

100.2 **Step 2—Convert Fate:** The hero may spend any number of their inspiration tokens. For each inspiration token they spend, they can convert one fate (leaf icon) icon on their revealed skill cards to one success (a sunburst symbol) icon.

- Abilities that a hero can resolve when they are performing a test are resolved during this step.

- A hero can spend any number of their inspiration tokens during each test.

- After a fate (leaf icon) icon is converted to a success (a sunburst symbol) icon, the fate (leaf icon) icon cannot be used for any other purpose and is no longer treated as a fate (leaf icon) icon.

100.3 **Step 3—Calculate Results:** The hero calculates the total number of success (a sunburst symbol) icons that the test produced and applies those successes according to the test's instructions, as follows:

- If the test provided a hero with a stat to test followed by a number (e.g., "Test (icon of a balzing fire); 2"), the hero passes the test if the number of success (a sunburst symbol) icons the test produced meets or exceeds the number that the test provided. Otherwise, the hero fails the test.

  - Some tests require the hero to select a "Pass" or "Fail" button in the app and some provide instructions for the hero to follow according to the test's outcome.

- If the test requires the hero to input the number of success (a sunburst symbol) icons that the test produced into the app, the hero uses the "+" and "–" buttons to increase or decrease the value until it matches the number of their success (a sunburst symbol) icons.

  - Many of these tests are cumulative and may require a hero to perform them multiple times. A cumulative test keeps track of the number of success (a sunburst symbol) icons that have been applied to it across multiple test attempts.

- If a hero is performing a test to negate damage (icon of 3 claw scratches) or fear (icon of a devil-like face with two curved horns), they suffer one fewer damage or fear for each success (a sunburst symbol) icon the test produces (see "Damage and Fear" on page 11).

- If a hero is performing a test to attack an enemy group, they spend each success (a sunburst symbol) icon that the test produced to resolve abilities on their items that add hits or modifiers to that enemy group (see "Attacks" on page 9).

  - Even if an attack does not add any hits or modifiers to an enemy group, the hero still selects "Apply" in the attack pane, which can cause a counterattack.

100.4 After calculating the results of the test, the hero discards all skill cards that were revealed during the test.

100.5 If the timing of an ability uses the language "after you test," the hero resolving that ability can do so after the "Calculate Results" step of any test.

### 101 THREAT BAR (page 26)

The threat bar is displayed along the top of the app's main screen and tracks the amount of threat accumulated during the adventure.

101.1 During The Threat Step Of Each Shadow Phase, the threat bar increases by the following amounts:

- Two For Each Hero In The Party

- one for each threat token on the game map

- one for each unexplored tile

101.2 When threat reaches the end of the threat bar, the adventure ends and the heroes lose.

101.3 The threat bar contains one or more thresholds. During the shadow phase, a threat event is resolved for each threshold that the threat bar meets or exceeds.

### 102 THREAT TOKENS (page 26)

A threat token may appear on the map and represents a threat within a space with which the heroes can interact.

102.1 By selecting a threat token in the app, a hero can read about what that specific threat token represents.

102.2 If a hero is in the same space as a threat token, they can interact with that token by performing an interact action (see "Interact Action" on page 16).

102.3 Any hero can select a threat token in the app at any time; however, they can only select a button that has an interact (icon of 2 right-pointed arrows) icon if they are performing an interact action.

102.4 During The Threat Step Of The Shadow Phase, threat increases by one for each threat token that is on the game map.

### 103 THRESHOLDS (page 26) 

See "Shadow Phase" on page 23 and "Threat Bar" on page 26.

### 104 TIERS (page 26)

See "Item Cards" On Page 17.

### 105 TITLE CARDS (page 26) 

Title cards are a type of skill card that heroes can gain during an adventure.

105.1 When a hero gains a title card, the app specifies the name of the title that the hero gains. Then, the hero gathers the specified title card and prepares it immediately.

- The app requires the hero who gained the title to be selected in the app—this allows the app to place that title card into that hero's inventory.

105.2 After a hero gains a title card, it is part of that hero's inventory for the duration of the campaign.

105.3 Like all skill cards, a hero can only resolve a title card's ability while it is prepared.

105.4 Abilities on many title skill cards instruct the hero to remove that skill card from the adventure; that title card should be set aside and cannot be used again until the next adventure. That title card will be shuffled into the hero's skill deck during setup of the next adventure.

### 106 TOKEN (page 26)

Token is the term used not only for the cardboard components that are placed on the map or on hero cards but also for the digital representation of those components in the app.

106.1 Every token that is displayed in the app corresponds to a physical version of that token on the game map.

- If there is an exploration, search, person, threat, terrain, or darkness token displayed in the app, there must be a corresponding physical token of the same type and in the same location on the game map.

106.2 If a rule or game effect instructs a player to select a token in the app, that player should tap on the image of the specified token.

### 107 TRAITS (page 27) 

A card may have one or more traits that are presented in italics at the top of that card's text box.

107.1 Traits are always presented in an italic typeface.

107.2 A trait has no inherent effects, but some game effects may refer to a card's trait.

### 108 TRAVEL ACTION (page 27) 

The travel action allows a hero to move around the game map.

108.1 When a hero performs a travel action, they can move up to two times.

108.2 If the first action during a hero's turn is a travel action, they can perform their second action and resolve other game effects between each of their moves.

108.3 For the rules for resolving a move, see "Movement" on page 19.

### 109 TRINKETS (page 27)

Trinkets (sack of coins icon) are a type of item card that heroes can gain during an adventure.

109.1 When a hero gains a trinket, the app specifies the name of the trinket that the hero gains. Then, the hero takes the specified trinket from the trinket deck and equips it.

- During an adventure, if a hero already has a trinket equipped, they can still equip any new trinkets they gain.

109.2 During the adventure in which a trinket is gained, only the specific hero who gained that trinket can equip it.

- After each adventure, all equipped trinkets are returned to the party'S inventory.

109.3 When a hero equips a trinket, they place a number of depletion tokens on that trinket equal to the number in the lower-left corner of the card ("Depletion Token" on page 12).

109.4 Unlike other items, trinkets belong to the entire party instead of individual heroes.

- During setup before each adventure, each hero can equip one trinket from among all the trinkets that the heroes have gained.

- The item menu in the app tracks all the trinkets that the heroes have gained during a campaign.

109.5 If a game effect instructs a hero to deplete a trinket, they remove one depletion token from that trinket.

- When a trinket has no remaining depletion tokens, it cannot be used; the hero flips the trinket facedown as a reminder that it has been fully depleted.

- While a trinket is facedown, the hero cannot resolve any of its abilities, even passive abilities.

109.6 A game effect can allow a hero to place a depletion token on a trinket.

- A hero can have a number of depletion tokens on a trinket that exceeds the number in the lower-left corner of that trinket's card.

- A hero can place a depletion token on a facedown trinket. When this happens, the trinket is flipped faceup and its abilities are available for the hero to resolve.

109.7 Each trinket describes when it can be used and how its effect is resolved.

- Most trinket abilities require that the trinket be depleted for its effect to be resolved.

### 110 UPGRADING ITEMS (page 27)

See "Lore" On Page 18.

### 111 WALL (TERRAIN) (page 27)

A wall is a terrain token that can be placed over a border on a battle map. ( image of a wall built with stones)

111.1 Spaces on opposite sides of a wall token are not adjacent—a hero or enemy cannot move across a border that contains a wall token.

- If wall tokens create diagonal spaces, those spaces are not adjacent.

111.2 If an ability, such as "Keen Eyes," allows for a hero or enemy to resolve a ranged attack that is up to two or more spaces away on a battle map, it may be possible for a hero or enemy to resolve a ranged attack against a target that is on the opposite side of a wall token.

### 112 WEAKNESSES (page 27) 

A weakness is a skill card that has no inherent game effect. It is designed to clutter a hero's skill deck and to provide no useful icons during a test.

112.1 During setup, each hero adds one random weakness card from the weakness deck to their skill deck.

112.2 It is possible for a hero to gain additional weaknesses during an adventure.

- Each weakness is taken from the top of the weakness deck.

112.3 All of a hero's weakness cards are removed from their skill deck between adventures.

112.4 Weakness cards can be prepared like other skill cards, but they have no effect while they are prepared. A prepared weakness counts as one of a hero's four prepared cards.

## QUICK REFERENCE (page 32)

### ROUND STRUCTURE (page 32)

Each game round consists of the following three phases:

1. **Action Phase:** Each hero takes a turn by performing two actions. 

2. **Shadow Phase:** Enemies activate, darkness is resolved (if necessary), and threat increases—threat events are activated if threat reaches a threshold.

3. **Rally Phase:** Each hero resets their skill deck and then scouts two cards.

### ACTIONS (page 32)

During a hero's turn, they can perform two actions. A hero can perform the same action twice or two different actions.

- **Travel:** Move up to two times. A hero can perform their second action between their first and second movement.

- **Attack:** Attack an enemy in your space. If you have a ranged weapon, you can attack a nearby enemy.

- **Interact:** Interact With A Token In Your Space.

### RESETTING SKILL DECKS (page 32) 

A hero must reset their deck at the following times:

- During The Rally Phase

- when there are no cards remaining in their deck

- when an effect instructs them to do so

A hero resets their deck by shuffling their discard pile with any remaining cards from their deck and placing the newly shuffled deck facedown. Prepared cards are not shuffled into the deck.

### FREQUENTLY OVERLOOKED RULES (page 32)

- When instructed to move and attack, if an enemy cannot get in range of any target, it ignores that entire instruction (including movement). The "No Target" button is selected and the enemy receives a new instruction.

- A readied enemy is provoked when a hero moves out of its space or when a hero interacts with a token in its space.

- A component is nearby another component if they are in the same space or adjacent spaces.

- A hero can have a maximum of four prepared cards at a time.

### ATTACK MODIFIERS (page 32)

There are six modifiers that can benefit heroes during an attack:

- **Pierce:** This attack ignores the enemy's armor.

- **Smite:** This attack ignores the enemy's sorcery.

- **Sunder:** This attack permanently reduces the enemy's armor by one (before hits are applied).

- **Cleave:** Each enemy in the group suffers the full number of hits.

- **Lethal:** If this attack reduces the enemy's current health by at least half, the enemy is defeated.

- **Stun:** This attack exhausts the enemy group. If the group is elite, it also cannot counterattack this attack.

### KEYWORDS (page 32)

- **Scout X:** When an effect instructs you to "Scout X," reveal X cards from the top of your skill deck. You may prepare one of those cards (place it faceup under your hero card). Then, place each of the remaining revealed cards on the top or bottom of your skill deck in any order.

- **Strike X:** During your attack test, you may discard a card that has the "Strike X" keyword to add X hits to the attack.

- **Guard X:** When you or a hero in your space would suffer damage or fear, you may discard a card that has the "Guard X" keyword to prevent any combination of X damage and fear.

- **Sprint X:** During your turn, you can discard a card that has the "Sprint X" keyword to move X additional spaces. You can perform actions between each movement.

- **Rest X:** At the end of your turn, you can discard a card that has the "Rest X" keyword to discard any combination of X of your facedown damage or fear cards.
