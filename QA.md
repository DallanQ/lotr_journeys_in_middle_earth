[discard-prepared-cards-at-any-time-plus-guard](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2713289/discard-prepared-cards-at-any-time-plus-guard)

> Are you allowed to discard a prepared skill card at any time?

No, you cannot discard a prepared skill card at any time. 

----
Manual.md page 14

when a hero scouts cards, that hero can prepare one of those cards by placing it faceup below their hero card. A hero cannot have more than **four** prepared cards; if they would prepare a fifth card, they must discard one of their prepared cards.

Like hero and item cards, skill cards have abilities that help the heroes accomplish their goals. However, a skill card's abilities can be used **only while that card is prepared**—in other words, the heroes ignore abilities on skill cards that are revealed for a test.

Each card ability describes when the ability can be used. To use an ability, the hero resolves the ability's text. Many skill card abilities instruct the hero to discard the card from their prepared area.

Reference.md page 16

43.2 A hero can only discard a card to use the "Guard X" keyword if that card is prepared.

> Are you allowed to use Guard without any damage or fear to prevent?

No, you are not allowed to use Guard without any damage or fear to prevent.

----
Reference.md page 16

Guard is a keyword that allows a hero to prevent damage (icon of 3 scratch claws) or fear (icon of devil-like face with two curved horns).

43.1 Any hero that is in the same space as a hero who would suffer damage (icon of 3 scratch claws) or fear (icon of devil-like face with two curved horns) can discard a card that has the "Guard X" keyword to prevent an amount of that damage and fear equal to X.

- A hero must choose to use the "Guard X" keyword before damage and fear cards are revealed.

- A hero can use the "Guard X" keyword to prevent damage (icon of 3 scratch claws) and fear (icon of devil-like face with two curved horns) to themselves.

- A hero can prevent any combination of damage (icon of 3 scratch claws) and fear (icon of devil-like face with two curved horns) that is equal to or less than X.

----
Reference page 16

43.3 Multiple abilities that have the "Guard X" keyword can be used to prevent damage (icon of 3 scratch claws) and fear (icon of devil-like face with two curved horns) from a single source. Multiple heroes can use abilities with the "Guard X" keyword to prevent damage and fear from the same source.

- If multiple heroes suffer damage (icon of 3 scratch claws) and fear (icon of devil-like face with two curved horns) while they are in the same space, a single ability that has the "Guard X" keyword can only prevent the damage and fear suffered by one of those heroes.

> If the app instructs you to place an enemy figure during the Shadow phase and it’s in a space where someone has Child of Lhun prepared, can the damage be applied to the enemy as if they “moved” into the space?

No, because "place" and "move" are different.

----
Reference.md page 19

60.5 If a game effect instructs a hero figure to be "placed" on the game map, that placement is **not** a move for purposes of game rules and interactions of game effects.

- If a hero is placed in a space from another space that contains one or more enemy groups, those enemy groups are **not** provoked.

> Time of Need: When you test, if you do not reveal any (*) [successes], you may discard this skill to convert all [fate] to (*) [successes].
> Rules 48.3: Inspiration: During a test, a hero can spend any number of their inspiration tokens. For each inspiration token they spend, they can convert one fate icon on their revealed skill cards to one success (*) icon.
> So, if I draw 2 fate cards, and use "Time of Need" and use 2 inspiration tokens, that would be 4 successes. OR are they mutually exclusive?

After a fate (leaf icon) icon is converted to a success (snow emoji icon) icon, the fate (leaf icon) icon cannot be used for any other purpose and is no longer treated as a fate (leaf icon) icon.

You can convert fate tokens using either inspiration tokens or a "Time of Need" card. You can't use both to double the number of successes.

----
Reference.md page 15

38.1 Unlike success (a sunburst symbol) icons, fate (leaf) icons have no inherent effect. However, during a test, a hero can spend any number of their inspiration tokens. For each inspiration token they spend, they can convert one fate (leaf icon) icon on their revealed skill cards to one success (a sunburst symbol) icon.

- After a fate (leaf icon) icon is converted to a success (a sunburst symbol) icon, the fate (leaf icon) icon cannot be used for any other purpose and is no longer treated as a fate (leaf icon) icon.

> If you get 4 successes, do you do 2 hits, 2 hits, and 3 hits stun in discrete packets or 7 hits and stun? This is a meaningful distinction because of the armor

If you got 4 successes you would do one hit for 7 hits and Stun. Armor only applies once per attack. The same goes for any Strike keywords you use on the attack, they increase it and don't separately plink off the armor.

----
Reference.md page 9

If the test produces at least two success (a sunburst symbol) icons, the hero passes the test and can apply four hits and stun to one nearby enemy group of their choice. Then, they discard the barrels token.

> Scenario 1: I am attacking with the Throat Seeker at range using Agility. In this case, I am not able to use Lassemaica either the ability "Before you attack..." or the success abilities since it is a ranged attack.

You cannot use the Success abilities, but any ability on a weapon that is not a Success ability is not subject to the same restriction. They are simply abilities with a trigger like any other. Sometimes the trigger will be "when you use this item in an attack" (See the tier 3 Sword, Sun-Silver) in which case, yes you need to use that item in the attack to use the ability. However absent such language, the attack may trigger the ability even if Lassemacia is not directly used in the attack.

The only trigger Lassemaica cares about is if you’re attacking. Nothing else about the attack matters. If you attack in any way, the ability triggers.

----
Reference.md page 9

the success (a sunburst icon) icons that the test produces are spent to resolve abilities on the item cards being used for the attack.

Many abilities on item cards are preceded by a cost that is represented by a success (a sunburst symbol) icon and a value (e.g., 2(a sunburst symbol)). To resolve such an ability, the hero must spend a number of success (a sunburst symbol) icons from among those produced by the attack test equal to the cost's value. Then, they resolve the ability's text.

[using-prepared-cards](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2767678/using-prepared-cards)

----
Manual.md page 12

When a hero suffers a damage or fear, they reveal a damage or fear card from the appropriate deck and place it faceup in their play area. Then, they resolve the card’s effect.**Many of these cards instruct the hero to flip the card facedown or discard it.**

A player doesn’t have to upgrade if he/she doesn’t want to. This is true for every upgrade level, so if a player wanted to remain at level 2 he/she could. A player isn’t able to downgrade once the selection is made, but nothing stops him/her from simply never upgrading in the first place.

If you only own the base game, then there is only 1 card available with the creature trait, but there are expansions for the game and in particular, one of them has a new role that's based around creatures. So you'd have a lot more creatures available if you had those expansions.

> Do you think that you have to test when the app tells you to negate? Let's say you want to use a **Guard** ability instead, because you want your successes for later use. Can you then ignore the negate option?

Abilities that explicitly use the word “prevent” always reduce damage or fear without the hero needing to perform a test. Guard is a keyword that allows a hero to **prevent** damage or fear. You're never required to perform a **'negate'** test if you'd rather keep successes on the top of your deck (i.e. for attacks). The Learn to Play rules clearly state that you **'may'** negate.

[seems-like-if-you-become-hidden-while-in-a-space-w](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2222224/seems-like-if-you-become-hidden-while-in-a-space-w)

>  If you become Hidden while in a space with enemies, you should be able to move out of that space without Provoking. Or at least test to skip Provoking?

Being hidden in this game is not being invisible. Since the enemy can attack you, it is just reasonable to assume that the enemy knows you are around and is able to hunt/attack you. It’s just that they know you’re around but not precisely where you are. If they do attack, they guess where your location is and miss (hence no physical damage) but it was so close that it scares the hell out of you (therefore the fear).

[does-negating-enemy-damage-also-negate-an-addition](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2301648/does-negating-enemy-damage-also-negate-an-addition)

> Does negating enemy damage also negate an additional penalty?
> Let's say that an orc attack says something along the lines of:
> Three damage + discard all boons / Might negates
> And the player pulls enough successes to completely negate the damage portion of the attack - do they still suffer the extra penalty (the losing boons portion in this example)?

By negating all the damage from the original source (the attack), you do not have to discard any inspiration. The 1 damage from the fear is considered a separate source. 

It depends on the exact wording. If it reads "Three damage, might negate. If you suffer any damage, discard all boons." then no, you will not suffer the effect if you negate all the damage. If it just reads "Three damage, might negate. Discard all boons." then they are two independent effects and you still lose all boons whether or not you take damage.

[ways-of-old](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2220948/ways-of-old)

> Will discarding allow you to do both and the text inside the brackets is just to clarify Sprint and that you can just use the Sprint outside of a test or are the 2 entirely separate abilities and only 1 can be activated?

They're separate abilities with the same cost (discarding the card), so you have to choose one or the other.

The cost of discarding can only be paid once. If you pay it for the first ability the card is no longer there to be discarded for the second ability.

[black-and-grey-hexsides](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2227861/black-and-grey-hexsides)

> What is the effect of black and grey hexsides on movement, and identifying which are blocked?

Grey hexside is needed to allow movement from an approved underground location. Spaces separated by black borders are not adjacent unless they are
connected by gray borders that are aligned together. Arrows point to gray borders to help players identify them—when two gray borders are
aligned, the arrows on each side of the aligned borders point toward each other. If two spaces are separated by black borders and their gray borders are
not aligned (in other words, if a gray border meets a black border), those spaces are not adjacent.

It happens at the same time as you're inputting hits/modifiers on the enemy. Per the simultaneous resolution rule, this means the players may decide if they want to do the Scout before or after inputting the rest of the attack on the enemy.

> What is the time when you attack with World's Burden and spend a successful to scout 2? (before/ when/after attack)

 It happens at the same time as you're inputting hits/modifiers on the enemy. Per the simultaneous resolution rule, this means the players may decide if they want to do the Scout before or after inputting the rest of the attack on the enemy.

Yes, the interpretation is correct. if it added another attack it would use the word "attack." It only lets you add 2 hits to an ally's attack already in progress. It has no other use. The enemy's placement is also irrelevant, so long as the ally attacking is in your space.

> Does the "pierce" effect apply to all 7 total damage? It doesn't seem to exist another way to inflict both attacks + effect in the app. So in that case, should I just apply 7+pierce on the app?
> If I got enough successes to kill the monster before revealing all the cards I can, do I need to keep "wasting" successes if they happen to be in the top of the deck?

Yes, if you can pay for both, you can do both. Each effect can be applied once per attack. You add up all the hits and you stack all the modifiers before hitting the apply button. So yes, 7 hits and "pierce" is correct in the example.

if the test results in 3 successes then you may pay 2 of those successes for the 5 plain hits and 1 success for the 2 hits plus pierce for a total of 7 hits plus pierce. In the app, you would apply 7 hits plus pierce.

You must draw all the necessary cards for the test before you start counting successes or converting fate icons via inspiration. They are not drawn one at a time and you cannot choose to draw fewer than your stat indicates you should draw even if you know you don't need them. This is true for any type of test, not only attack tests.

it is imperative to Stun enemies or otherwise restrict their movement so that you can still be active even with them on the board. If the enemy wastes their turn moving two spaces you don't care after all an exhausted enemy doesn't get to move anywhere. When you decide you need to thin the horde somewhat, ranged attacks and Stun attacks are key to preventing the counterattack. You have limited Inspiration to spend and you'd rather not spend it on negate tests but taking hits can easily chain and spiral into a disaster depending on what you draw from the Damage/Fear deck.

> We are having really bad results on our campaign as we are usually getting swarmed by A LOT of enemies and not struggling a lot to be alive and complete out objectives even though we are playing in normal mode. We normally try to explore first with the "weakest" characters and fight with the strong ones. But as we explore, more and more enemies come.
> Must we explore quickly to accomplish the final objective before the red bar is full?

Yes, you do have to explore quite quickly. You want to keep your Threat generation low at all times to keep the Threat events coming as slowly as possible. This means Threat tokens are priority 1. If you can explore multiple unexplored zones in one turn, do it. However keep in mind what tiles you explore as tiles near the edge are likely to reveal even more unexplored tiles, sometimes resulting in a net negative.

As you just discarded it it is no longer in your play area so no it wouldn't count as the "cost" was to discard it to Scout. The cost must be paid before beginning to resolve the effect. So once the effect resolves, Nightingale is no longer in the play area.

> If you have the card Inspiring Presence prepared, do you have to discard it for the nearby hero to scout or discard facedown damage or fear instead of gaining inspiration?

The card text for Inspiring Presence does not say to discard it. Thus, you do not discard it. 

The card does not specify any cost for invoking it once the trigger condition is met so no cost need be paid. (And for clarity's sake discarding the card would be a cost)

> When a ranged enemy is one field away from Aragorn, the app displays: Move 1 and attack Aragorn. Do I have to move the Ranged Enemy on the board to the field of Aragorn, or does the ranged enemy stand still and not move?

First, the enemy group moves up to the indicated number of spaces toward the targeted hero, taking the shortest path of spaces possible. The enemy group stops when it is in range of that hero.

[movement-stop-or-pass-field-with-opponent](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2761471/movement-stop-or-pass-field-with-opponent)

> Can I go through a field where an enemy is standing?
> Example: An opponent is standing on a neighboring field. To get to the fields that have not yet been discovered, my hero has to pass the field with the opponent. Since I can walk at least two fields, I want to pass the opponent’s field and then go to the next field (without an opponent).
> Do I have to stop or can I pass?

Each movement from one space to an adjacent space is considered a separate movement. If you encounter one or more enemy groups in the space you're moving to you have to provoke each enemy group in that space before you can move to the unexplored tile.

You can move through a field with one or more enemy groups. However, as soon as you move out of a field with one or more enemy groups on it, you usually have to "provoke" all of them. To provoke an enemy group, click on the icon next to the enemy bar in the app and then click on the icon of that enemy group in the bar next to it. You need to repeat this for all the enemy groups in the particular field you are moving from. The only exceptions to this rule are the following:

1. you must not (and cannot) provoke enemy groups that are already exhausted. Exhausted enemy groups are those that have already fought or been "stunned" during the player's action phase.

2. you do not have to provoke enemy groups if you trigger appropriate card effects that prevent this.

In the latest expansion "Shadow of War" new field types called "Fortified" were added. Fortified means, among other things, that players cannot move out of fields with enemies if the number of enemies in that field is greater than the number of player characters in that field. That is the only reason you cannot move out of a field with enemies

Bilbo managed to get it, but we came into the situation where it was critical to hand out the item to Aragorn, who was on the same tile as Bilbo.
> is it possible to do it, or not?

 No it is not possible. The rules says that you can't trade anything between players. The only time some sort of trading is allowed is when one hero finds an item and the app says that "you or a nearby hero can equip this item". (item or anything like that, of course... what I mean is you can't trade unless the app says you are doing so). 

 > What if two different heroes take one medicine each?

 The quest asks you to intereact with the ranger using a hero who has one of the tokens. So if a hero has the token, he can interact with the ranger, meaning that the answer for your second question is YES.

> If someone only has 1 card prepared, can they do the first half, Or does a player need to have 2 cards prepared to choose that option?

> Are we only selecting one? Or if more than one on a card can apply to the situation can we use all the multiple effects on the card that do?

If a card has multiple abilities listed on it, treat them as completely separate. This can occasionally cause conflicts if the two abilities have the same cost, for instance, if they both require you to discard the card then you cannot discard the card once to invoke both abilities - you would need to pick one.

However if only one ability requires a discard, and the other does not, such as the case with the card Keen Eyes, then the first ability would be active for as long as the card is prepared and at any time you want to use the Strike portion of the card you could discard it to add two hits. Doing so would obviously cause the card to no longer be prepared and thus you would lose the benefit of the first ability, the extra range.

> The Fang Pendant has pierce and "defeat an enemy group to gain 1 inspiration". You have to deplete the item (1) and can only use it once...can you still use the pierce effect OR do you lose the entire item for the current mission after gaining one inspiration?

25.2 If a game effect instructs a hero to deplete a trinket, they remove one depletion token from that trinket.
• When a trinket has no remaining depletion tokens, it cannot be used; the hero flips the trinket facedown as a reminder that it has been fully depleted.
• A hero cannot resolve passive abilities or abilities that do not require the depletion of the trinket while that trinketis facedown.

So you do lose the ability to use the attack ability once the card is facedown.

> How do ranged monsters attack? The spear goblins have a ranged attack. If a hero is 2 spaces away and the monster attacks that hero, does it move 2 spaces and attacks or does it only move 1 space and attack from there because of the ranged weapon?

an enemy will stop moving when it is in range of its target. Thus, the goblins would only move 1 space in the example.

 it means gain a free attack action. Nowhere does it reference that it has to be the same target, and thematically when I think of "leading the charge" the participants often attack different enemies.

The Hammer and Tongs trinket should read, “When you attack or test to negate Damage or Fear, you may deplete this trinket to convert 1 Fate to 1 Success.” It has three depletion tokens on it starting each adventure, and it can be depleted during either an attack or a negate test. It has never received an errata, nor is it currently being considered for any errata.

> When doing a skill check, do you have to draw all of the cards, or can you stop drawing whenever you want. For example, if I am doing a might test and need 1 success, and my might is 3, if I draw a success on the first card drawn, can I then stop drawing? 

The cards are technically all drawn at the same time. It's not an iterative process. So no, you can't stop halfway. 

You reveal all the cards you are supposed to, then check the test success.
“To perform a test, a hero reveals cards from the top of their skill deck. The number of cards they reveal is equal to the value of the stat being tested.
After revealing cards, the hero determines the number of success“

Also, remember that you always want to know as much about your deck as possible - not just what is available but also what isn’t available. So even if you pass the test with the success on the first of three cards, you will also know what those other cards are.

Let me first translate it into the actual game terminology in English:

If you would test agility or might, you may deplete this item to test might or agility instead.

It does make sense, as some characters may now switch a weaker ability by a stronger one. For instance Gimli has very limited agility and may choose to test might (his higher stat) instead if wearing the boots. If Legolas had them donned, he would be able to test agility (his higher stat) instead of might (lowest).

> a) Do we choose the card we faceup or is it chosen randomly?

a. Yes. Any time you do anything with facedown Damage/Fear (flipping, discarding, etc.) it must be done randomly. You're never allowed to remember what facedown Damage/Fear cards are and use that to your advantage.

b. Yes to most of that. If a card is flipped faceup it will once again trigger its text. If that text simply has it flip facedown again then it will do exactly that and you've lucked out. Remember though that Laceration will only flip facedown AFTER the card it flips has finished doing its thing. So if your only other card is a card that would flip Laceration faceup, you don't enter an infinite loop of the two cards flipping each other forever.

> if one damage/fear card tells you to “flip one face up then discard this card” but the one that gets flipped tells you to “flip this card face down” does it stay face up or face down?

Face up or down fear/damage still count as 1 damage each. Many effects can avoid or remove face-down damage or fear. Far fewer can remove face-up damage or fear. So it's important to make sure you follow the instructions of the app exactly when it deals you damage/fear.

When you're instructed to turn a face-down damage/fear face up, you have to fully resolve it again (just as if you'd just drawn it). In your specific example, the card you flipped face-up would immediately be flipped face down again. That's the BEST result you can hope for when you're flipping up a face-down card!

> If that's true, it's a nice little interaction that the second copy lets you use it as a basically a Strike 2, or extra insurance against forced discard knocking you out of bear form at an inopportune time, or any other "discard a card" effects.

the first ability of The First Beorning is constantly applied. Just to be clear, we intend for each ability on a card to be resolved according to its timing. If an ability has no explicit timing (like the first ability on The First Beorning) that ability is considered to be active as long as that card is prepared. Usually it will have no effect, as you cannot change to The Great Bear as long as you are The Great Bear. However, if any game effect, including discarding a copy of The First Beorning, causes you to change to Beorn while a copy of The First Beorning is prepared, you would resolve the first ability of The First Beorning again fully before continuing with the game.

You can choose to end your Sprint with any amount of movement remaining, whether it be 0 or 3. When you do so, any movement you have not yet moved is forfeit and this is when you trigger any After you Sprint effects.

Yes. This one is pretty straightforward. The first ability doesn’t have a discard cost, which means that the card is still available to discard for Guard after the damage goes through.

>  Can I use the ability from "Reinforced Shield" to prepare "Ready Defense" after I discarded it to use it's Guard ability? Rule 1.15 states, that if multiple abilities resolve at the same time (both Guard and "Reinforced shield" use the timing "when"), you can determine the order in which those abilities resolve yourself. So if you would still suffer damage after negation, you could trigger Guard from "Ready Defense" first, which puts it in the discard pile, and then trigger the ability of "Reinforced Shield" to prepare "Ready Defense".

Provided at least one Damage for you to suffer made it through, yes that’s fine.

> Crazily enough, as "Ready Defense" is now again a prepared card, could I use it's Guard ability... again? This doesn't sound correct, but I can't find rules against it.

Yes. Timing is still legal (when you would suffer Damage) and you have the card available to discard so I’d say yes.

>  Last question: could you prepare a card with Guard that was revealed during negation with "Reinforced shield's" ability? Rule 22.13 said, you can negate first and then prevent. That means, you make the negation test first, putting all revealed cards into your discard pile, making them available for the ability of "Reinforced Shield".

Yes. Suffering happens after negation so any cards put into discard by the negate are legal targets by the time the Shield resolves.

“You” always refers to the hero holding the card. “When you attack” can thus only be used when you yourself attack.

If two actions require a cost you cannot pay the cost once to pay for both actions.

Both Sprint and Hide have a cost of discarding the card. That's a cost you can only pay once so you'll only be able to use one of the two abilities.

However, the first ability on Sneaking does not have a cost. So may use it for as long as you have the card prepared without paying anything. However, at some point you may want to "cash in" by using one of the two bold abilities. You'll lose the passive ability at the top but gain the benefit of whatever you discarded for.

> For "point the way" it says my ally can get inspiration for each leaf icon spent during a test.... Is it referring to each inspiration token I spend to convert a leaf? Or am I spending leafs on the cards that are revealed?

The leaf icon always refers to the icons found on the cards themselves. If the game means inspiration, it will always spell out the word “inspiration.” What Point the Way does is it allows you to take a certain number of Fate symbols from cards revealed during your test and treat them as though they’re not there in order to give your ally an equal amount of inspiration. Once you do this, you cannot spend that Fate in other ways (such as converting it with inspiration.) But it’s very useful if you draw excess symbols during your test.

Ultimately, we determined there would not be a penalty since there was no mention of one.

If you don't have the inspiration to lose, then there is no additional penalty. This is also true for similar situations, such as discarding a prepared card when you have none.

> If I a ranged unit is told to move four spaces towards the closest hero, Will it stop adjacent to the hero even though it's not attacking this turn? Or do I just move it on to the space with the hero?

If it doesn't say "attack" then the range isn't considered. They will move into the space of nearest hero if they can. If it says move 2 and attack and 2 moves will put it in range then it will do that.

RR section 30.2 clears up all these situations, albeit with slightly confusing sequencing. The basics are that if a move instruction is not specifically targeted, then it uses the target of the attack and stops moving when in range of the target. If the move instruction is targeted (as in the case of move towards the closest hero) then the enemy keeps moving until it reaches the target or runs out of movement.

[soldier-card-45-and-6](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2739264/soldier-card-45-and-6)

> The Soldier card 4,5 and 6 of the new expansion is confusing me. There are two parts to it, both equally confusing to me.
> “Before you travel, you MUST discard this skill and scout 1”, ok I can follow this but don’t understand the rational behind it.
> “Before you attack, you may move 1 space”, wouldn’t this be pointless with a melee weapon surely?

No it’s not. The second ability will not trigger the first as it is not a Travel Action. The point of the card is that so long as you have other means of movement (like Sprint or effects similar to its second effect) you are able to keep the card prepared for a very long time, which means you’ll be able to take a lot of movement without spending actions and can spend those actions on other things, such as attacking.

The card will only trigger its first effect when you explicitly use the Travel Action. Not if you move by other means.

[clarification-on-keyword-a-hero](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2201733/clarification-on-keyword-a-hero)

> Can't find my answer on the forum so far.
> If a card say "A hero". Does it mean your hero too ? Or others ? The card I'm not sure about is a 12 XP Guardian card helping people to ignore damage on success. Does it work for everyone including me or only for my mates ?

Defense Instruction works on any hero in the game regardless of their proximity to you.

A Hero - any good guy in the game
You - only the person with the card
Nearby Hero - only allies of the card-carrier who are near him (but not the card carrier himself)
You or a Nearby Hero - same as above but the card carrier may benefit this time.

The story explanation of Defense Instruction is that during your off time you taught your friends how to defend themselves against attacks and then the lessons pay off when they need them most. You don't need to be near them for that.

Only the arrow symbol requires to spend an action. The choices within an interaction all belong to the initial action.

Clicking on tokens is free. You only spend an interact action if you want to choose an option with an arrow. If the token keeps giving you options with no arrow, you don’t need to spend any actions on them. This does mean that some tokens though take multiple actions to complete.

According to RAW, once a character has a scepter token they are stuck with it. They can't trade it, drop it, or do anything with it. If the character goes down to a Last Stand and they have the only scepter token you are, what we call in the business, outta luck.

Yes. From page 14 of LtP: “Resetting Skill Decks"

A hero must reset their skill card deck at the following times:

during the rally phase

when there are no cards remaining in their deck

when an effect instructs them to do so

A hero resets their deck by shuffling their discard pile with any remaining cards in their deck and placing the newly shuffled deck facedown. Prepared cards are not shuffled into the deck.”

> After threat rises, the app says an orc looses an arrow - Bilbo suffers 2 damage. He is hidden. 
> Is this an attack and prevented by hidden or does "suffer" mean its not an attack and hidden doesn't apply here?

Hidden would not stop that. Hidden only triggers during an enemy attack and that is very specifically when an enemy figure performs an attack against you.

Additionally, the word "suffer" in reference to damage or fear doesn't mean anything special other than damage or fear that is dealt to a hero. Technically damage or fear from an enemy attack is also considered to be "suffered."

No, it stays at zero. Reducing threat before that threshold is a waste.

Removing a threat token will always slow the amount of threat gathered every turn since you'll remove it from the board.

> Does Aragorn's ability for heroes to draw one additional card trigger on the initial setup round each mission/adventure? 
> Or is it only on subsequent "Rally" rounds? 

The Rally phase comes after the action phase it is the end of a round, there are cards that let you take things out of your discard during rally phase
learn to play guide:
1. Action Phase: During this phase, the heroes move around the
map, interact with the world, and attack enemies.
2. Shadow Phase: During this phase, the enemies move and attack
heroes, and other dark threats grow stronger.
3. Rally Phase: During this phase, the heroes prepare for the
next round.

the Rally Phase does not happen unless the app says RALLY PHASE in the center of the screen. The chance to prep cards at the start of an adventure is a hard-coded event for each adventure that isn't related to any particular phase.

it's simply to ensure you only start with one weakness. there is nothing within the app that makes reference to a specific weakness being in your deck or play area.

> Regarding line 1. Can you spend more than one inspiration to prevent multiple fear and/or damage? Or is it limited to one inspiration and 1 fear or damage?

Yes. The general rule is that when there is a cost (in this case spend 1 inspiration), you can activate it multiple times. It may seem powerful for a simple cloak but you may need inspiration for other things.

> Regarding line 2. I assume "facedown" specifically means when the app tells you to suffer "X" amount of facedown damage or fear. It does not mean when you draw a damage or fear card and the card tells you to place it face down, correct?

Correct. It is only when the app tells you directly that it is facedown.

You absolutely do not need to provoke enemies in order to attack them.

The only two things that will provoke an enemy are if you move out of a space occupied by an enemy or if you attempt to perform an interact action while in a space with an enemy. In both cases, the enemies can only be provoked if they are not exhausted.

No. An attack of opportunity (i.e. counterattack) is not an activation. An enemy activation is its own structure step, per page 13 of the rules reference:

During the shadow phase, each readied enemy group activates.

Do I also have to resolve each dmg/fear flipped up as a result as well? This confuses me the most- flip face up; The card says flip face down. So what should I do?

Yes, you do resolve the cards you flip faceup. This doesn't appear to be made clear in the RR specifically, but that is how the cards work. Most cards will flip themselves back facedown after you resolve them unless they have an ongoing effect.

> As a result of attack or shadow phase I receive a dmg/fear card which tells me to reduce my stats. Is that in effect immediately or for the next action phase?

It's immediate and permanent until you can flip the card back facedown or discard it.

> There are fear/dmg. cards which tell you to flip them face down at the end of your turn. Does that mean that they usually must be effective for whole next turn?

If gained during the shadow phase, they will last for your whole next turn yes. If gained from a counter-attack, they will only be around for your remaining action/s.

> Title cards Friend of dwarfs / friend of elves.. I received them, they say I possess the benefits of being elf/dwarf. Is that the case regardless of these cards being on my hand or in my deck? Or only effective when I have them on my hand?

> Or does that mean I can choose to attack with the mount instead of using my weapon? For two whole hits? 
> when you have options for 1 success versus 1 success versus 2 successes all on the same weapon/card, does that mean when I get 2 successes on my card draw, I can either choose to take the two single 1 options OR take the 2 success option? I guess what I mean to ask is.. I don't have to take the successes in order of how they appear, top to bottom, on the card, right? As long as I can pay the proper number of successes, I can choose whichever I want on the card, right? One example I guess would be the hunter's bow where 1 success is 3 hits, or 1 success is 3 hits with pierce. If I only get 1 success, I'm going to take the 3 hits with pierce... I can do that, right? I don't have to take the topmost non-pierce attack?

When you make an attack you choose a skill to test that matches at least one of your equipped items (usually a weapon). If you have more than one item that uses the same skill (e.g. two weapons, weapon and support item, weapon and mount) you can split your successes across the items in any order (up to the total number of successes)

For example, let's say you have a sword and a war charger mount. You choose to test Might which applies to both items. The sword card is 1 Success 2 hits, 2 success 5 hits, while War Charger is 1 Success 2 hits. You get two successes on your test, so you can either use the sword 2 success line to do 5 hits, or choose the sword 1 Success line to do 2 hits and the War Charger 1 Success line to do 2 hits. Obviously you would choose the 5 hits in this case, but with keywords it isn't always obvious which is best (e.g. you may have a choice between doing more damage or applying stun).

You definitely don't have to take the lines in order, but you can't apply any line more than once on a single attack.

In theory you could choose to attack with a mount and no weapon (e.g. you have War Charger and a Great Bow and for some reason you choose to attack with Might) - it seems unlikely but if you had an enemy with only 2 health left and you had Undying Might prepared it may be the safest option to guarantee killing that enemy.

> Gimli has several ability cards that let him add 1 success while defending to prevent 1 dmg or 1 fear. The question is, can he has multiple of this cards prepared and add the together to add successes to the defend check? Are the cards get discarded when he uses this ability? (Doesnt say anything on the cards). It does say though to discard it when he uses it as a Guard 2.

This defender skill is strong as you don't have to discard it and it's cumulative. Although, keep in sight that it depletes your deck from its success symbols and future skill tests will be more difficult.

> We have found the Extra Rations trinket. The trinket has some uses (i think 2). What happened when there are no depletion tokens left? Does it refill at the end of each chapter?

Any trinket can be used until depleted, at which point it is turned over and does not apply again unless more depletion tokens are put on later. At the end of each scenario, you get to assign up to one trinket per character, fully recharged, and any character can use any trinket you've gained.

The beginning of the next chapter lets you upgrade gear and trinkets in the app, and it lets you know what is available for upgrade based on your lore.

> Is the timing such that a player can do the "before you sprint" part of the card, then attempt to Sprint, but that is prevented by the "cannot"?

If you have Quickbeam equipped then you can never attempt to Sprint which means that “before you Sprint” effects can never be triggered. Pretend that the Sprint keyword isn’t even on the card.

> When a card combo like Merry Chase/Quickbeam is in effect at the start of the game, does that mean the player has to wait till he/she prepares a 5th skill (or have some other game effect cost a prepared skill) before he/she can discard it?
> If a player can do the "before you Sprint" and then try to sprint and it fizzles, May the player then discard that prepared card? (which otherwise would just sit there useless till I would gain a 5th prepared card or have to discard one.)

if a card has no other way listed on the card to discard it then you must wait until you have another game effect to discard it. This could be over-prepared or it could be another game effect such as a Damage/Fear card or a skill card like Master Tactician. However, it is not a very big deal given that Merry Chase has no symbols and it’s not like having it prepared stops the player from preparing other cards. It’s probably better to have it prepared since it means a player can’t draw it in tests, same reason players need to regularly prepare their Weakness cards.

The person using the card is not being “placed.” They are moving normally so they will still provoke attacks. Since the person being teleported is being placed and not moving, you are correct that they won’t provoke attacks.

That is correct. Officially, each "session" or chapter is called an adventure by the rules. The entire game is referred to as the "campaign."

Unless told otherwise, you will begin every single adventure with exactly one weakness (no more, no less), all the titles you've earned, and your role's #1 card (the one with stars around the name) prepared.
