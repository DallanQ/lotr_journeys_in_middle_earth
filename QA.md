[discard-prepared-cards-at-any-time-plus-guard](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2713289/discard-prepared-cards-at-any-time-plus-guard)

> Are you allowed to discard a prepared skill card at any time, or does it have to be replaced by another prepared card? Additionally, can you use Guard if there is no damage or fear to prevent?

No, you cannot discard a prepared skill card at any time, nor do you have to replace it with another prepared card. Also, you are not allowed to use Guard if there is no damage or fear to prevent.

Reference.md page 6

A hero can only resolve an ability on a skill card while that skill card is prepared.

Reference.md page 6

An ability that requires a card to be discarded cannot be resolved if the card is discarded by another game effect

Reference.md page 16

Guard is a keyword that allows a hero to prevent damage (icon of 3 scratch claws) or fear (icon of devil-like face with two curved horns).

43.1 Any hero that is in the same space as a hero who would suffer damage (icon of 3 scratch claws) or fear (icon of devil-like face with two curved horns) can discard a card that has the "Guard X" keyword to prevent an amount of that damage and fear equal to X.

- A hero must choose to use the "Guard X" keyword before damage and fear cards are revealed.

- A hero can use the "Guard X" keyword to prevent damage (icon of 3 scratch claws) and fear (icon of devil-like face with two curved horns) to themselves.

- A hero can prevent any combination of damage (icon of 3 scratch claws) and fear (icon of devil-like face with two curved horns) that is equal to or less than X.

----
Reference page 16

43.3 Multiple abilities that have the "Guard X" keyword can be used to prevent damage (icon of 3 scratch claws) and fear (icon of devil-like face with two curved horns) from a single source. Multiple heroes can use abilities with the "Guard X" keyword to prevent damage and fear from the same source.

- If multiple heroes suffer damage (icon of 3 scratch claws) and fear (icon of devil-like face with two curved horns) while they are in the same space, a single ability that has the "Guard X" keyword can only prevent the damage and fear suffered by one of those heroes.

----
Reference.md page 32


**Guard X:** When you or a hero in your space would suffer damage or fear, you may discard a card that has the Guard X keyword to prevent any combination of X damage and fear.

Reference.md page 20

69.4 A hero can have up to four prepared cards at the same time.

After a hero prepares one or more skill cards, if that hero has
more than four prepared cards, they must discard any of their
prepared cards until only four cards remain prepared

> If the app instructs you to place an enemy figure during the Shadow phase and it’s in a space where someone has Child of Lhun prepared, can the damage be applied to the enemy as if they “moved” into the space?

 No, because "place" and "move" are different.

----
Manual.md page 13

 **Interrupting Enemy Activations:** Some abilities, such as Elena’s 'Child of the Lhun' skill card, can interrupt an enemy’s activation to apply hits or modifiers. To resolve these abilities, the hero selects the enemy’s portrait, inputs and applies hits or modifiers indicated by the ability, then continues the enemy’s activation.

> Can I use both Time of Need and inspiration tokens in the same test? If I draw 2 [fate] icons, can I activate Time of Need to convert them to [successes] and then spend 2 inspiration tokens for a total of 4 successes, or are these abilities mutually exclusive?

Once a fate (leaf icon) is converted to a success (snow icon), it can no longer be used for any other purpose and is no longer treated as a fate icon.

You can use either inspiration tokens or the Time of Need card to convert fate icons, but you can’t use both to double the successes.

----
Reference.md page 15

38.1 Unlike success (a sunburst symbol) icons, fate (leaf) icons have no inherent effect. However, during a test, a hero can spend any number of their inspiration tokens. For each inspiration token they spend, they can convert one fate (leaf icon) icon on their revealed skill cards to one success (a sunburst symbol) icon.

- After a fate (leaf icon) icon is converted to a success (a sunburst symbol) icon, the fate (leaf icon) icon cannot be used for any other purpose and is no longer treated as a fate (leaf icon) icon.

----
Reference.md page 25

95.3 During a test, a hero can spend any number of their inspiration tokens. For each inspiration token they spend, they can convert one fate (leaf icon) icon on their revealed skill cards to one success (a sunburst symbol) icon.

1.7 If multiple abilities resolve at the same time, the party determines the order in which those abilities resolve.

Example: If a skill card has two abilities that require the skill card
to be discarded—one text ability and one keyword—the hero cannot
discard that card and resolve both of its abilities

> I have two prepared cards that have the skill of Strike 2. The goblin I am attacking has a health meter of 4. Do I need to do an attack skill test using my weapon to kill him? Or can I use the two "Strike 2" cards without testing?

The text on strike says "during an attack test" which means that you must be making the test. You are required to reveal cards for the test.

----
Reference.md page 24

93.1 When a hero is performing **an attack test**, that hero can discard a card that has the "Strike X" keyword to add X hits to the enemy group that is the target of that attack.

You do not need to prepare a card when you Scout. The rules say "That hero may prepare one of those cards"

----
Reference.md page 32

When an effect instructs you to "Scout X," reveal X cards from the top of your skill deck. **You may prepare** one of those cards (place it faceup under your hero card). Then, place each of the remaining revealed cards on the top or bottom of your skill deck in any order.

You'll have the Darkness token icon in front of the threat bar when it is (and an explicit "The map is in Darkness" type message will have announced it at some point).

----
Manual.md page 8

A hero is in darkness if any of the following three conditions apply: 

- They are in a space with a printed darkness icon.
  
- They are in a space with a darkness token.

- The app states that they are in darkness.
  
----
Reference.md page 11

23.1 Some spaces on the map have a darkness icon printed on them. These spaces are always in darkness.

23.2 Game effects can add darkness to specific spaces on the map. When this happens, a darkness token is placed on that space to represent that the space is in darkness.

23.3 The app may indicate that the entire game map is in darkness. When this happens, there is a darkness icon on the screen in the app to indicate that all the spaces on the map are in darkness—it is not necessary to place a darkness token on each space of the game map.

----
Reference.md page 23

83.2 **Step 2—Darkness:** Each hero that is in a space that contains darkness suffers an amount of fear (icon of a devil-like face with two curved horns) indicated by the app.

If darkness is not present on the game map and if the app is not causing darkness, the app automatically skips the “Darkness” step.

> If you achieve 4 successes with a staff that reads "1: 2 hits, 1: 2 hits, 2: 3 hits and a stun," do you deal 2 hits, 2 hits, and 3 hits with a stun as separate packets, or does it combine into a total of 7 hits and a stun? This distinction is important when considering armor effects.

If you got 4 successes you would do one hit for 7 hits and Stun. Armor only applies once per attack. The same goes for any Strike keywords you use on the attack, they increase it and don't separately plink off the armor.

----
Reference.md page 9

If the test produces at least two success (a sunburst symbol) icons, the hero passes the test and can apply four hits and stun to one nearby enemy group of their choice. Then, they discard the barrels token.

If the test produces fewer than two success (a sunburst symbol) icons, the hero fails the test and nothing happens.

You discard when the card specifically tells you to do so, or when you're using the card to perform a keyword whose instructions specifically tell you to discard the card.

----
Manual.md page 12

When a hero suffers a damage or fear, they reveal a damage or fear card from the appropriate deck and place it faceup in their play area. Then, they resolve the card’s effect.**Many of these cards instruct the hero to flip the card facedown or discard it.**

More in general, if, for example, for whatever reason a player prefers to keep using one item at level II up to the moment he/she has enough points to upgrade the item at level IV, can the player do it?

A player doesn’t have to upgrade if he/she doesn’t want to. This is true for every upgrade level, so if a player wanted to remain at level 2 he/she could. A player isn’t able to downgrade once the selection is made, but nothing stops him/her from simply never upgrading in the first place.

> Do you think that you have to test when the app tells you to negate? Let's say you want to use a **Guard** ability instead, because you want your successes for later use. Can you then ignore the negate option?

Abilities that explicitly use the word “prevent” always reduce damage or fear without the hero needing to perform a test. Guard is a keyword that allows a hero to **prevent** damage or fear. You're never required to perform a **'negate'** test if you'd rather keep successes on the top of your deck (i.e. for attacks). The Learn to Play rules clearly state that you **'may'** negate.

> Can a Sprint 2 (or 3) be broken up the same way a travel action can? So can I Sprint 1, attack/interact, then Sprint 1 more? Or does a Sprint 2 have to be all at once?

You can break up sprint as well. Think about it like it adds movement points.

[seems-like-if-you-become-hidden-while-in-a-space-w](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2222224/seems-like-if-you-become-hidden-while-in-a-space-w)

> If you become Hidden while in a space with enemies, you should be able to move out of that space without Provoking. Or at least test to skip Provoking?

Being hidden in this game is not being invisible. Since the enemy can attack you, it is just reasonable to assume that the enemy knows you are around and is able to hunt/attack you. It’s just that they know you’re around but not precisely where you are. If they do attack, they guess where your location is and miss (hence no physical damage) but it was so close that it scares the hell out of you (therefore the fear).

[does-negating-enemy-damage-also-negate-an-addition](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2301648/does-negating-enemy-damage-also-negate-an-addition)

> If an enemy attack includes both damage and an additional penalty (e.g., "3 damage + discard all boons" with Might to negate), and the player fully negates the damage, does the additional penalty (like losing boons) still apply?

By negating all the damage from the original source (the attack), you do not have to discard any inspiration. The 1 damage from the fear is considered a separate source. 

It depends on the exact wording. If it reads "Three damage, might negate. If you suffer any damage, discard all boons." then no, you will not suffer the effect if you negate all the damage. If it just reads "Three damage, might negate. Discard all boons." then they are two independent effects and you still lose all boons whether or not you take damage.

[ways-of-old](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2220948/ways-of-old)

> Can both the top and bottom effects of this card (scout and sprint) be used together? If discarding the card enables both, is the text in brackets simply clarifying that Sprint can be used outside of a test, or are these two separate abilities, allowing only one to be activated at a time?

They're separate abilities with the same cost (discarding the card), so you have to choose one or the other.

The cost of discarding can only be paid once. If you pay it for the first ability the card is no longer there to be discarded for the second ability.

[black-and-grey-hexsides](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2227861/black-and-grey-hexsides)

> What is the effect of black and grey hexsides on movement, and identifying which are blocked?

Grey hexside is needed to allow movement from an approved underground location. Spaces separated by black borders are not adjacent unless they are
connected by gray borders that are aligned together. Arrows point to gray borders to help players identify them—when two gray borders are
aligned, the arrows on each side of the aligned borders point toward each other. If two spaces are separated by black borders and their gray borders are
not aligned (in other words, if a gray border meets a black border), those spaces are not adjacent.

> How do Cavalry Combat and Fighting Advance work if their effects move you out of range before provoking an enemy or making an attack?

You would move away after the negate but then no longer be able to perform the Interact test, forfeiting the Interact and taking a Provoke for nothing.

> What happens if Beorn uses Maranwe or World's Burden to attack, scouts 2, and then prepares The First Beorning?

According to the simultaneous resolution rule, when Beorn attacks with Maranwe or World's Burden and scouts, players can choose whether to perform the Scout action before or after applying hits and modifiers to the enemy. This timing flexibility allows you to decide the most advantageous sequence for the attack and scouting.

> What is the time when you attack with World's Burden and spend a successful to scout 2? (before/ when/after attack)

 It happens at the same time as you're inputting hits/modifiers on the enemy. Per the simultaneous resolution rule, this means the players may decide if they want to do the Scout before or after inputting the rest of the attack on the enemy.

[voluntary-discard-of-first-beorning-beorn-4-5](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3327532/voluntary-discard-of-first-beorning-beorn-4-5)

> Can a card without a discard mechanic, such as First Beorning (Beorn 4-5), be discarded voluntarily? For instance, First Beorning states: "Change to The Great Bear. When this card is discarded, change to Beorn," and specifies replacing your hero card, figure, and equipped items upon changing.

You cannot voluntarily discard prepared cards. The Great Bear's ability forces you to discard a card when you interact so you could always use that to discard The First Beorning.

> Why do weapons and other objects that have already reached level three keep showing a lore amount as if they could reach a new level?

Yeah. The sensible length for a campaign is 6 to 12 scenarios, but they can go insane and release 30 to 40 scenario campaigns and further item development would be nice to have.

[inspiration-between-adventures](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2190190/inspiration-between-adventures)

> The skill reads: "You can strike with this skill when another hero in your space attacks. Strike 2 (When you attack, discard to add 2 hits.)" My understanding is that you can use it to add 2 hits to an ally’s attack in the same space or to your own attack, discarding the card afterward. Is this correct, or are there other ways to use the ability?

Yes, the interpretation is correct. if it added another attack it would use the word "attack." It only lets you add 2 hits to an ally's attack already in progress. It has no other use. The enemy's placement is also irrelevant, so long as the ally attacking is in your space.

> If I use a travel action and sprint 3 skill, I then can move 5 tiles. If I stop after the third tile and interact with a token or attack an enemy, can I use my remaining 2 tile moves after that?

Yes, you may.

From the rules reference:
89.2 A hero can perform other actions and resolve other game effects between each movement that is provided by the “Sprint X” keyword.

108.2 If the first action during a hero’s turn is a travel action, they can perform their second action and resolve other game effects between each of their moves.

 It does that because if it can attack the named character, it always does so. Only if it cannot do you go to another character it can attack.

[stacking-success-for-different-attacks-and-a-more](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2237751/stacking-success-for-different-attacks-and-a-more)

> If I have a weapon that deals 2 damage + pierce with 1 success and 5 damage with 2 successes, and I get 3 successes, can I perform both attacks? Does "pierce" apply to all 7 damage? Should I apply 7 damage + pierce in the app, and if I can kill the monster early, do I still need to use extra successes from the deck?

Yes, if you can pay for both, you can perform both attacks. Each effect applies once per attack. In your example, with 3 successes, you can use 2 for 5 damage and 1 for 2 damage + pierce, totaling 7 damage + pierce. In the app, you would apply 7 damage + pierce.

You must draw all necessary cards for the test before counting successes or using inspiration. You can't draw fewer cards than your stat indicates.

> We're struggling in our campaign, getting swarmed by enemies even in normal mode. We explore with weaker characters first and fight with stronger ones, but more enemies keep appearing. Should we explore faster to complete the final objective before the red bar fills up?

Yes, you do have to explore quite quickly. You want to keep your Threat generation low at all times to keep the Threat events coming as slowly as possible. This means Threat tokens are priority 1. If you can explore multiple unexplored zones in one turn, do it. However keep in mind what tiles you explore as tiles near the edge are likely to reveal even more unexplored tiles, sometimes resulting in a net negative.

[nightingale-beast-friend-2](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3336366/nightingale-beast-friend-2)

> Nightingale has the effect: "Before you test, you may discard this skill to scout 2, revealing 1 additional card for each creature in your play area." Does Nightingale count itself?

No, Nightingale would not count itself. Since it’s discarded as part of the cost to scout, it is no longer in your play area when the effect resolves. The cost is paid before the effect begins.

[inspiring-presence](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2230603/inspiring-presence)

> If you have the card Inspiring Presence prepared, do you have to discard it for the nearby hero to scout or discard facedown damage or fear instead of gaining inspiration?

Inspiring Presence doesn’t mention discarding the card, so you don't discard it. Since the card doesn’t specify a cost to activate it after the trigger condition is met, no cost needs to be paid. (For clarity, discarding the card would be considered a cost.)

[scout-clarification](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2210523/scout-clarification)

> If someone scouts 3 and selects one card to prepare, leaving 2 cards, can they place one card on top and the other on the bottom of the deck, or must they place both cards either on top or on the bottom?

Yes, you can place one on the top and the other on the bottom.

Movement between adjacent spaces is separate. If you move into a space with enemies, you must provoke each enemy group before proceeding. To provoke, click the enemy icon in the app. Exceptions:

 1. You cannot provoke exhausted enemies (those who’ve fought or been stunned).
 2. No provocation if a card effect prevents it.

In the "Shadow of War" expansion, "Fortified" fields prevent movement out of a space if enemy numbers exceed player characters.

Bilbo managed to get it, but we came into the situation where it was critical to hand out the item to Aragorn, who was on the same tile as Bilbo.
> is it possible to do it, or not?

 No it is not possible. The rules says that you can't trade anything between players. The only time some sort of trading is allowed is when one hero finds an item and the app says that "you or a nearby hero can equip this item". (item or anything like that, of course... what I mean is you can't trade unless the app says you are doing so).

 > What if two different heroes take one medicine each?

 The quest asks you to intereact with the ranger using a hero who has one of the tokens. So if a hero has the token, he can interact with the ranger, meaning that the answer for your second question is YES.

> How should skill cards with multiple effects (e.g., an ability and then "Strike 2" below it) be used? Are we limited to selecting just one effect, or can we apply all the relevant effects on the card if they apply to the situation?

If a card has multiple abilities, treat them as separate. If both abilities have the same cost, such as requiring a discard, you can only use one at a time. However, if only one ability requires a discard (like Keen Eyes), you can use the first ability as long as the card is prepared, and discard it later to use the Strike effect, which would cause the card to no longer be prepared.

You could also prepare Gather Supplies, gain the inspiration, then discard Resourceful instead so that you can benefit from the stronger end-of-turn effect of Gather Supplies if you wanted. You do not have to discard the same card you prepared when you over prepare.

> The Fang Pendant has pierce and "defeat an enemy group to gain 1 inspiration". You have to deplete the item (1) and can only use it once...can you still use the pierce effect OR do you lose the entire item for the current mission after gaining one inspiration?

25.2 If a game effect instructs a hero to deplete a trinket, they remove one depletion token from that trinket.
• When a trinket has no remaining depletion tokens, it cannot be used; the hero flips the trinket facedown as a reminder that it has been fully depleted.
• A hero cannot resolve passive abilities or abilities that do not require the depletion of the trinket while that trinketis facedown.

So you do lose the ability to use the attack ability once the card is facedown.

> How do ranged monsters attack? The spear goblins have a ranged attack. If a hero is 2 spaces away and the monster attacks that hero, does it move 2 spaces and attacks or does it only move 1 space and attack from there because of the ranged weapon?

an enemy will stop moving when it is in range of its target. Thus, the goblins would only move 1 space in the example.

 it means gain a free attack action. Nowhere does it reference that it has to be the same target, and thematically when I think of "leading the charge" the participants often attack different enemies.

The Hammer and Tongs trinket should read, “When you attack or test to negate Damage or Fear, you may deplete this trinket to convert 1 Fate to 1 Success.” It has three depletion tokens on it starting each adventure, and it can be depleted during either an attack or a negate test. It has never received an errata, nor is it currently being considered for any errata.

You can look at anything you want without consuming an action. Tokens, the hint for the Threat event, enemy stats.... you name it.

Let me first translate it into the actual game terminology in English:

If you would test agility or might, you may deplete this item to test might or agility instead.

It does make sense, as some characters may now switch a weaker ability by a stronger one. For instance Gimli has very limited agility and may choose to test might (his higher stat) instead if wearing the boots. If Legolas had them donned, he would be able to test agility (his higher stat) instead of might (lowest).

If it’s possible to apply multiple hits to a single line, what’s the purpose of having these duplicate lines?

Each line on the weapon card can be activated only once per test, so you can’t stack successes on a single line to multiply its effect.

Addittionally, if one damage/fear card tells you to “flip one face up then discard this card” but the one that gets flipped tells you to “flip this card face down” does it stay face up or face down?

Face up or down fear/damage still count as 1 damage each. Many effects can avoid or remove face-down damage or fear. Far fewer can remove face-up damage or fear. So it's important to make sure you follow the instructions of the app exactly when it deals you damage/fear.

When you're instructed to turn a face-down damage/fear face up, you have to fully resolve it again (just as if you'd just drawn it). In your specific example, the card you flipped face-up would immediately be flipped face down again. That's the BEST result you can hope for when you're flipping up a face-down card!

[preparing-two-copies-of-the-first-beorning-then-di](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2804656/preparing-two-copies-of-the-first-beorning-then-di)

If I'm playing Beorn and have **The First Beorning** prepared in Bear Form, then prepare a second copy, nothing happens. If I discard the first copy (due to **Rending Claws** or an enemy attack), **The First Beorning** says, "Change to The Great Bear. When this card is discarded, change to Beorn." After discarding, I change to Beorn, but since "Change to The Great Bear" seems like a constant effect, do I immediately change back to Bear Form? Does the second copy act as extra insurance against forced discards, allowing me to stay in Bear Form?

The first ability of **The First Beorning** is always active while the card is prepared. Abilities with no explicit timing are considered active, but usually have no effect (since you can’t change to The Great Bear while already in Bear Form). If a game effect, like discarding a copy of The First Beorning, causes you to change to Beorn, you would resolve the first ability again, changing back to The Great Bear before continuing.

You can choose to end your Sprint with any amount of movement remaining, whether it be 0 or 3. When you do so, any movement you have not yet moved is forfeit and this is when you trigger any After you Sprint effects.

This also means that yes, you may trigger a Before you Sprint effect and then end the Sprint after moving 0 spaces.

You understand it correctly. No matter how many fate you convert to success, you still only get to add 1 additional success.

According to Rule 22.13, I can negate first and then resolve abilities that prevent damage/fear, so this should be possible, right? After discarding Ready Defense for Guard, can I use Reinforced Shield to prepare it again? If Ready Defense is prepared, can I use its Guard ability again? Also, can I prepare a Guard card revealed during negation by Reinforced Shield?

Yes, you can use Ready Defense to negate damage or fear, then discard it for Guard. Since the first ability has no discard cost, it remains available after negation.

You can then use Reinforced Shield to prepare Ready Defense. Once prepared, you can use its Guard ability again, as long as you’re suffering damage. There’s no rule against reusing it.

You can also prepare a Guard card revealed during negation, as negated cards go into the discard pile and are available for Reinforced Shield.

Can I use this for any hero's attack, or only mine?

“You” always refers to the hero holding the card. “When you attack” can thus only be used when you yourself attack.

However as you noticed, Elf-Wrights’ Grace doesn’t say that. It says, “when a hero attacks.” Since it doesn’t say “you” it can be used when ANY hero attacks, regardless of how close you are to them. That’s the cool thing about it.

> The Sneaking card (BURGLAR 5) has two actions in bold. How should I play this card? If I discard it, can I use both actions in bold, or just one?

You can’t pay the cost once for both actions. Since both Sprint and Hide require discarding the card, you can only use one.

The first ability on Sneaking has no cost, so you can use it as long as the card is prepared. Once you discard the card for Sprint or Hide, you lose the passive ability but gain the benefit of the discarded action.

> For "point the way" it says my ally can get inspiration for each leaf icon spent during a test.... Is it referring to each inspiration token I spend to convert a leaf? Or am I spending leafs on the cards that are revealed?

The leaf icon always refers to the icons found on the cards themselves. If the game means inspiration, it will always spell out the word “inspiration.” What Point the Way does is it allows you to take a certain number of Fate symbols from cards revealed during your test and treat them as though they’re not there in order to give your ally an equal amount of inspiration. Once you do this, you cannot spend that Fate in other ways (such as converting it with inspiration.) But it’s very useful if you draw excess symbols during your test.

Could they for instance test with Elena, draw no Fate, and Spend 1 Inspiration to do nothing and still activate her personal ability to grant an Inspiration to a nearby hero?

Yes, as the rules specifically allow you to spend as much inspiration as you wish during a test, Elena may choose to spend 1 inspiration even if there are no Fate revealed in that test to convert.

Point 60.4 from the RRG: If a hero wishes to move out of a space that contains one or more readied enemy groups, before that hero moves the must provoke each readied enemy group in the space.

> We encountered a situation where a player failed a test, took damage, and lost 1 Inspiration. What happens if you don’t have any Inspiration left? Is there a penalty for this? Since the app didn’t mention any penalty, we assumed there wouldn't be one.

If you don't have the inspiration to lose, then there is no additional penalty. This is also true for similar situations, such as discarding a prepared card when you have none.

[move-4-spaces-towards-hero-ranged-enemies](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3020314/move-4-spaces-towards-hero-ranged-enemies)

> If I a ranged unit is told to move four spaces towards the closest hero, Will it stop adjacent to the hero even though it's not attacking this turn? Or do I just move it on to the space with the hero?

If it doesn't say "attack" then the range isn't considered. They will move into the space of nearest hero if they can. If it says move 2 and attack and 2 moves will put it in range then it will do that.

RR section 30.2 clears up all these situations, albeit with slightly confusing sequencing. The basics are that if a move instruction is not specifically targeted, then it uses the target of the attack and stops moving when in range of the target. If the move instruction is targeted (as in the case of move towards the closest hero) then the enemy keeps moving until it reaches the target or runs out of movement.

 1. “Before you travel, you MUST discard this skill and scout 1.” I get the action, but I don’t understand the reasoning behind it.
 2. “Before you attack, you may move 1 space.” Wouldn’t this be pointless with a melee weapon?

No it’s not. The second ability will not trigger the first as it is not a Travel Action. The point of the card is that so long as you have other means of movement (like Sprint or effects similar to its second effect) you are able to keep the card prepared for a very long time, which means you’ll be able to take a lot of movement without spending actions and can spend those actions on other things, such as attacking.

The card will only trigger its first effect when you explicitly use the Travel Action. Not if you move by other means.

> Is a counterattack a form of activation? They exhaust the enemies just a normal activation in the shadow phase. I’m asking because I want to use the Nemesis title to prevent the attack portion of the counterattack.

No. An attack of opportunity (i.e. counterattack) is not an activation. An enemy activation is its own structure step, per page 13 of the rules reference:

During the shadow phase, each readied enemy group activates.

> Can both attacks be completed before the enemy counterattacks, or do you need to finish one attack, take damage, then perform the second attack?

No, they counter after each action (if able).

[some-rules-still-not-clear-flipping-dmgfear-cards](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2417908/some-rules-still-not-clear-flipping-dmgfear-cards)

> Flipping dmg/fear cards. When you get a card as a result of attack OR during shadow phase, the card tells you to flip another facedown dmg/fear faceup. Do I also have to resolve each dmg/fear flipped up as a result as well? This confuses me the most- flip face up; The card says flip face down. So what should I do?

Yes, you do resolve the cards you flip faceup. This doesn't appear to be made clear in the RR specifically, but that is how the cards work. Most cards will flip themselves back facedown after you resolve them unless they have an ongoing effect.

> As a result of attack or shadow phase I receive a dmg/fear card which tells me to reduce my stats. Is that in effect immediately or for the next action phase?

It's immediate and permanent until you can flip the card back facedown or discard it.

> There are fear/dmg. cards which tell you to flip them face down at the end of your turn. Does that mean that they usually must be effective for whole next turn?

If gained during the shadow phase, they will last for your whole next turn yes. If gained from a counter-attack, they will only be around for your remaining action/s.

> Title cards Friend of dwarfs / friend of elves.. I received them, they say I possess the benefits of being elf/dwarf. Is that the case regardless of these cards being on my hand or in my deck? Or only effective when I have them on my hand?

You must have the title prepared for it to be in effect.

[discard-question](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2188696/discard-question)

>If I have a card prepared and the card's description doesn't say anything about discarding it after using it's ability (for example Gimli's Fury card), does that mean I get to use the ability for the rest of the scenario if I want to and only discard the card to make room for some other cards I want to prepare?

Correct. Stays prepared unless you ditch it for being over the limit of 4.

> In this quest you close and open map tiles (203A 205A 207A), can enemys move through 'closed' map tiles?

No, they can't. If those tiles are not present, then they can't be used.

[paths-unseen](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2732427/paths-unseen)

> Does the Paths Unseen card allow both the sprinter (user of the Paths Unseen card) and the "teleported" to not provoke attacks?

The person using the card is not being “placed.” They are moving normally so they will still provoke attacks. Since the person being teleported is being placed and not moving, you are correct that they won’t provoke attacks.

[trailblazer](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2713262/trailblazer)

> If I use the Pathfinder #1 card for Sprint 1, do I automatically gain 1 inspiration from the "Before you sprint..." text, or is it a choice between gaining inspiration or sprinting?

When the skill is prepared, the text is active, so gaining the inspiration applies to the same card too.

[shooting-around-corners](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3194962/shooting-around-corners)

> Since range depends on spaces being adjacent only, are all shots allowed if a path can be traced regardless of how ridiculous the shot would be in reality?

Yes, all shots are allowed if a path can be traced.

[remove-from-adventure](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2491744/remove-from-adventure)

> When a card is removed from the adventure, does it return in the next scenario of the campaign? For example, I was instructed to remove a weakness from each character's deck, should these cards be placed back in the decks for the next scenario?

Yes, that's correct. Each "session" or chapter is considered an adventure in the rules, while the whole series of adventures is the campaign. Unless specified otherwise, you will start each adventure with one weakness, the titles you've earned, and your role's #1 card (the one with stars around the name) prepared.
