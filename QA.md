> Are you allowed to discard a prepared skill card at any time?

No, you cannot discard a prepared skill card at any time. The rules for discarding cards mention only doing so when you have over 4.

No, you are not allowed to use Guard without any damage or fear to prevent.

> If the app instructs you to place an enemy figure during the Shadow phase and it’s in a space where someone has Child of Lhun prepared, can the damage be applied to the enemy as if they “moved” into the space?

I would say that placing the enemy figure during Shadow Face is not a "move". Enemies are moving only when the app specifically uses the word "move” during the enemy’s activation.

[time-of-need-and-inspiration](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2194290/time-of-need-and-inspiration)

> Can I double dip with Time of Need and inspiration?
> Time of Need: When you test, if you do not reveal any (*) [successes], you may discard this skill to convert all [fate] to (*) [successes].
> Inspiration: During a test, a hero can spend any number of their inspiration tokens. For each inspiration token they spend, they can convert one fate icon on their revealed skill cards to one success (*) icon.
> So, if I draw 2 fate cards, and use "Time of Need" and use 2 inspiration tokens, that would be 4 successes. OR are they mutually exclusive?

After a fate () icon is converted to a success () icon, the fate () icon cannot be used for any other purpose and is no longer treated as a fate () icon.

You can convert fate tokens using either inspiration tokens or a "Time of Need" card. You can't use both to double the number of successes.

> if you draw 2 fate icons, And you use "time of need" does this mean you can convert 2 fate icons into 2 succes or only the one fate icon which is in the left corner on the "time of need" card?

If a player is using Time of Need to convert Fate into Successes that means that it is one of his/her prepared cards and therefore not part of his/her draw. Symbols are only relevant and able to be converted when drawn as part of a test. So the player would gain 2 Successes from the 2 Fate he/she drew as part of the test.

> I have two prepared cards that have the skill of Strike 2. The goblin I am attacking has a health meter of 4. Do I need to do an attack skill test using my weapon to kill him? Or can I use the two "Strike 2" cards without testing?

The text on strike says "during an attack test" which means that you must be making the test. You are required to reveal cards for the test so it seems you must make the test to spend the prepared cards.

If you got 4 successes you would do one hit for 7 hits and Stun. Armor only applies once per attack. The same goes for any Strike keywords you use on the attack, they increase it and don't separately plink off the armor.

[combined-weapon-and-abilities](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3020254/combined-weapon-and-abilities)

> I am attacking with the Throat Seeker at range using Agility. In this case, I am not able to use Lassemaica either the ability "Before you attack..." or the success abilities since it is a ranged attack.

You cannot use the Success abilities, but any ability on a weapon that is not a Success ability is not subject to the same restriction. They are simply abilities with a trigger like any other. Sometimes the trigger will be "when you use this item in an attack" (See the tier 3 Sword, Sun-Silver) in which case, yes you need to use that item in the attack to use the ability. However absent such language, the attack may trigger the ability even if Lassemacia is not directly used in the attack.

The only trigger Lassemaica cares about is if you’re attacking. Nothing else about the attack matters. If you attack in any way, the ability triggers.

> I am in the same space as the enemy, I chose to attack with the Throat Seeker using Agility, I am still able to use Lassemaica Success-skills, but am I still able to use its non-success skill since I initially declared my attack with the Throat Seeker?

Lassemacia's ability does not rely on it being used in the attack. However, I'm not sure why this question would ever be relevant since if this situation ever arises, there is no reason not to simply attack with both weapons. You don't gain any benefit from only declaring the Hatchet. Indeed, you cannot change items once the attack has begun, but I don't see what's stopping you from simply declaring both items here.

[using-prepared-cards](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2767678/using-prepared-cards)

> When I have a card prepared, do I have to discard it when played? Or do I discard it only when it tells me to? 
> A) Hunter 6 - Quick Snare "Tactic - Before you Strike with this skill, add stun to the attack. Strike 1" Always keep prepared? Don't discard at all?
> B) Burglar 1 - Self Sufficient (top part) "When you test, if there are no nearby heroes, you may convert 2 inspiration to 1 success. (bottom part) Hide (After you test, discard to become hidden.)" Top part keep prepared? Only discard if I do the bottom part?

You discard when the card specifically tells you to do so, or when you're using the card to perform a keyword whose instructions specifically tell you to discard the card. Strike is an example; here are the rules for that keyword: "Strike X: During your attack test, you may discard a card that has the “Strike X” keyword to add X hits to the attack."

For Self-Sufficient, it's exactly like you think. The effect is persistent and you can keep using the top part so long as you meet the conditions. Only the bottom part discards.

For Quick-Snare it follows the same rules, you only discard if the card tells you to. However, Quick Snare is a bit sneaky about how it tells you to discard because of the word Strike. Strike, like all keywords, requires a discard. It's part of the definition of the word in this game. Even though the reminder text isn't present on Quick Snare, Strike still requires a discard whether the reminder text is present or not, and since the top ability of Quick Snare requires you to Strike with it, there's no way to use either of effects without discarding it.

[upgrading-equipment](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3075689/upgrading-equipment)

More in general, if, for example, for whatever reason a player prefers to keep using one item at level II up to the moment he/she has enough points to upgrade the item at level IV, can the player do it?

A player doesn’t have to upgrade if he/she doesn’t want to. This is true for every upgrade level, so if a player wanted to remain at level 2 he/she could. A player isn’t able to downgrade once the selection is made, but nothing stops him/her from simply never upgrading in the first place.

If you only own the base game, then there is only 1 card available with the creature trait, but there are expansions for the game and in particular, one of them has a new role that's based around creatures. So you'd have a lot more creatures available if you had those expansions.

As long as the means you had to get the card back was via an effect with "end of turn" timing, then yes, you may use it right away again.

> If I am using the 2 actions from HR, and I cross a river, do I get to continue with my bonus actions, or am I finished? Rivers state that my "turn ends" but my turn was already over and HR activates at the end of my turn.

Yes, you do. Technically you are prepping at the end of a round as The Scout phase is the last thing. Action phase, Shadow phase then Scout phase.

There are Cards/effects that allow you to do things in that scout phase that would require it to be the last thing in a round.

> Do you think that you have to test when the app tells you to negate? Let's say you want to use a Guard ability instead, because you want your successes for later use. Can you then ignore the negate option?

Abilities that explicitly use the word “prevent” always reduce damage or fear without the hero needing to perform a test. Guard is a keyword that allows a hero to **prevent** damage or fear. You're never required to perform a **'negate'** test if you'd rather keep successes on the top of your deck (i.e. for attacks). The Learn to Play rules clearly state that you **'may'** negate.

[seems-like-if-you-become-hidden-while-in-a-space-w](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2222224/seems-like-if-you-become-hidden-while-in-a-space-w)

>  If you become Hidden while in a space with enemies, you should be able to move out of that space without Provoking. Or at least test to skip Provoking?

Being hidden in this game is not being invisible. Since the enemy can attack you, it is just reasonable to assume that the enemy knows you are around and is able to hunt/attack you. It’s just that they know you’re around but not precisely where you are. If they do attack, they guess where your location is and miss (hence no physical damage) but it was so close that it scares the hell out of you (therefore the fear).

[does-negating-enemy-damage-also-negate-an-addition](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2301648/does-negating-enemy-damage-also-negate-an-addition)

> Does negating enemy damage also negate an additional penalty?
> Let's say that an orc attack says something along the lines of:
>Three damage + discard all boons / Might negates
>And the player pulls enough successes to completely negate the damage portion of the attack - do they still suffer the extra penalty (the losing boons portion in this example)?

By negating all the damage from the original source (the attack), you do not have to discard any inspiration. The 1 damage from the fear is considered a separate source. 

It depends on the exact wording. If it reads "Three damage, might negate. If you suffer any damage, discard all boons." then no, you will not suffer the effect if you negate all the damage. If it just reads "Three damage, might negate. Discard all boons." then they are two independent effects and you still lose all boons whether or not you take damage.

[ways-of-old](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2220948/ways-of-old)

> Is it possible to do both the top and bottom parts of this card (i.e. scout & sprint)?
> Will discarding allow you to do both and the text inside the brackets is just to clarify Sprint and that you can just use the Sprint outside of a test or are the 2 entirely separate abilities and only 1 can be activated?

They're separate abilities with the same cost (discarding the card), so you have to choose one or the other.

A cost of discarding can only be paid once. If you pay it for the first ability the card is no longer there to be discarded for the second ability. The example I usually give is if you walk into a store with a single $5 bill, grab two different items that each cost $5, and attempt to pay at the register using the single bill for both items you'd get a lot of funny looks.

[black-and-grey-hexsides](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2227861/black-and-grey-hexsides)

> What is the effect of black and grey hexsides on movement, and identifying which are blocked?

Grey hexside is needed to allow movement from an approved underground location. Spaces separated by black borders are not adjacent unless they are
connected by gray borders that are aligned together. Arrows point to gray borders to help players identify them—when two gray borders are
aligned, the arrows on each side of the aligned borders point toward each other. If two spaces are separated by black borders and their gray borders are
not aligned (in other words, if a gray border meets a black border), those spaces are not adjacent.

[cavalry-combat-plus-fighting-advance-the-first-beo](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2768561/cavalry-combat-plus-fighting-advance-the-first-beo)

> What happens when you use calvary combat and fighting advance to cause you to move away from the grid before you provoke the enemy or attack?

You would move away after the negate but then no longer be able to perform the Interact test, forfeiting the Interact and taking a Provoke for nothing.

> What is the time when you attack with World's Burden and spend a successful to scout 2? (before/ when/after attack)

It happens at the same time as you're inputting hits/modifiers on the enemy. Per the simultaneous resolution rule, this means the players may decide if they want to do the Scout before or after inputting the rest of the attack on the enemy.

> Is Fighting Advance designed for items with ranged icons?

No, you can use it to move from a space where you cannot attack an enemy to one where you can and then attack them. So if you have a melee weapon and are in a space with no enemies, but there is an enemy in the space next to you, you may use Fighting Advance to move into that enemy’s space and attack them.

>  If I attack with rending claws and discard TFB I become Beorn only after the attack, even thought I loose the card during the attack, which makes me loose the rending claws?

An attack is a multistep process which is broken down like this in the rules:
1. Choose item and stat
2. Choose target
3. Test and results
4. Counterattack (if applicable).
Since the Rending Claws are available for step 1, we choose them for the attack. Everything proceeds normally until we get halfway through step 3. At this point when we discard The First Beorning, it will happen simultaneously with the rest of the results from the test. So Rending Claws leaves your play space at the same moment that it applies however many hits you did with it during the attack. You won't be able to use your man-form weapon in the attack since it wasn't selected during step 1. During the counterattack, you will be in man-form since you change at the end of step 3.

> If Beorn use Boasting (one way to make the bear usefull in the end game), how do the timing of the hoary coat (after taking ... prepare one card from discard) interact with the above timing sequence?
> Is the **"after"** still anywhere you want in "3. Test and results" or is it a separate sequencing that somehow interact with the above sequence?
> What happens if you discard the bear to get +2 hit in relation to the above?

**“After”** occurs immediately after the trigger in question. In the case of Boasting, you would use it and convert all your Fates to success after you draw the cards for the test, but before you confirm the results. Immediately after that you suffer the Fear and trigger Hoary Coat to prepare a card from discard. If the card you prepare is useful in the attack, you could use it if you want.

Change to The Great Bear. When this card is discarded, change to Beorn. (When you change, replace your hero card, figure, and equipped items.)

You cannot voluntarily discard prepared cards. The Great Bear's ability forces you to discard a card when you interact so you could always use that to discard The First Beorning.

It’s future-proofing so that they can release further upgrades for longer campaigns later if they want. The sensible length for a campaign is 6 to 12 scenarios, but they can go insane and release 30 to 40 scenario campaigns and further item development would be nice to have.

[inspiration-between-adventures](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2190190/inspiration-between-adventures)

[thrice-forged-steel](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2637157/thrice-forged-steel)

> The skill in references reads, “You can strike with this skill when another hero in your space attacks.
Strike 2 (When you attack, discard to add 2 hits.)”
> The way I read it is, if your character who has this card prepared is in a space with an ally and that ally attacks an enemy in the same space, you can strike to that ally’s attack and add 2 hits. Then the card is discarded. Or, you can use it on your own attack to strike and add two hits and discard the card.
> Is the interpretation correct and are there any other ways to use the ability?

Yes, the interpretation is correct. if it added another attack it would use the word "attack." It only lets you add 2 hits to an ally's attack already in progress. It has no other use. The enemy's placement is also irrelevant, so long as the ally attacking is in your space.

> You had 2 hits to an ally's attack in progress if this ally is in your space, but you don't discard the skill.
Am I right?
> You discard it only if you use it for one of your attacks.

The wording is essentially stating that you may use the Strike ability to help someone else's attack instead of yours. You are still using Strike and Strike discards the card being used. So the card is discarded either way.

89.2 A hero can perform other actions and resolve other game effects between each movement that is provided by the “Sprint X” keyword.

> Why does the app ask to attack a named character when we always go to the closest or if is the same distance, we can choose?

 It does that because if it can attack the named character, it always does so. Only if it cannot do you go to another character it can attack.

> Does the attack happen even if the enemies are in a space with another hero?

Yes. If the enemy can reach their named target they will move and attack that target regardless of the state of anything else on the board. They will only attack the closest hero if their named target is unreachable.

> If I got enough successes to kill the monster before revealing all the cards I can, do I need to keep "wasting" successes if they happen to be in the top of the deck?

Yes, if you can pay for both, you can do both. Each effect can be applied once per attack. You add up all the hits and you stack all the modifiers before hitting the apply button. So yes, 7 hits and "pierce" is correct in the example.

if the test results in 3 successes then you may pay 2 of those successes for the 5 plain hits and 1 success for the 2 hits plus pierce for a total of 7 hits plus pierce. In the app, you would apply 7 hits plus pierce.

You must draw all the necessary cards for the test before you start counting successes or converting fate icons via inspiration. They are not drawn one at a time and you cannot choose to draw fewer than your stat indicates you should draw even if you know you don't need them. This is true for any type of test, not only attack tests.

it is imperative to Stun enemies or otherwise restrict their movement so that you can still be active even with them on the board. If the enemy wastes their turn moving two spaces you don't care after all an exhausted enemy doesn't get to move anywhere. When you decide you need to thin the horde somewhat, ranged attacks and Stun attacks are key to preventing the counterattack. You have limited Inspiration to spend and you'd rather not spend it on negate tests but taking hits can easily chain and spiral into a disaster depending on what you draw from the Damage/Fear deck.

> We are having really bad results on our campaign as we are usually getting swarmed by A LOT of enemies and not struggling a lot to be alive and complete out objectives even though we are playing in normal mode. We normally try to explore first with the "weakest" characters and fight with the strong ones. But as we explore, more and more enemies come.
> Must we explore quickly to accomplish the final objective before the red bar is full?

Yes, you do have to explore quite quickly. You want to keep your Threat generation low at all times to keep the Threat events coming as slowly as possible. This means Threat tokens are priority 1. If you can explore multiple unexplored zones in one turn, do it. However keep in mind what tiles you explore as tiles near the edge are likely to reveal even more unexplored tiles, sometimes resulting in a net negative.

> Will  Nightingale count itself?

As you just discarded it it is no longer in your play area so no it wouldn't count as the "cost" was to discard it to Scout. The cost must be paid before beginning to resolve the effect. So once the effect resolves, Nightingale is no longer in the play area.

[inspiring-presence](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2230603/inspiring-presence)

> If you have the card Inspiring Presence prepared, do you have to discard it for the nearby hero to scout or discard facedown damage or fear instead of gaining inspiration?

The card text for Inspiring Presence does not say to discard it. Thus, you do not discard it. 

The card does not specify any cost for invoking it once the trigger condition is met so no cost need be paid. (And for clarity's sake discarding the card would be a cost)

[movement-with-range-enemies](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2190115/movement-with-range-enemies)

> When a ranged enemy is one field away from Aragorn, the app displays: Move 1 and attack Aragorn. Do I have to move the Ranged Enemy on the board to the field of Aragorn, or does the ranged enemy stand still and not move?

First, the enemy group moves up to the indicated number of spaces toward the targeted hero, taking the shortest path of spaces possible. The enemy group stops when it is in range of that hero.

> If one ranged enemy has an instruction to move 1 and attack the hero, did he move away from 1 case and attack me after?

If he is already in your space then he will already be in range and simply attack you without moving at all. Enemies can only use movement to decrease the distance between themselves and their target.

> After choosing “no target” for a ranged enemy it says “Move 6 spaces toward the closest hero” not “to the nearest space adjacent”. So, what happens then? Still adjacent or on top?

When given a target for the move, the enemy will move towards that target as far as it can, so it will enter the space. Enemies generally only stop at ranged distance when moving to attack, or when given instructions.

[movement-stop-or-pass-field-with-opponent](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2761471/movement-stop-or-pass-field-with-opponent)

> Can I go through a field where an enemy is standing?

> Do I have to stop or can I pass?

Each movement from one space to an adjacent space is considered a separate movement. If you encounter one or more enemy groups in the space you're moving to you have to provoke each enemy group in that space before you can move to the unexplored tile.

You can move through a field with one or more enemy groups. However, as soon as you move out of a field with one or more enemy groups on it, you usually have to "provoke" all of them. To provoke an enemy group, click on the icon next to the enemy bar in the app and then click on the icon of that enemy group in the bar next to it. You need to repeat this for all the enemy groups in the particular field you are moving from. The only exceptions to this rule are the following:

1. you must not (and cannot) provoke enemy groups that are already exhausted. Exhausted enemy groups are those that have already fought or been "stunned" during the player's action phase.

2. you do not have to provoke enemy groups if you trigger appropriate card effects that prevent this.

In the latest expansion "Shadow of War" new field types called "Fortified" were added. Fortified means, among other things, that players cannot move out of fields with enemies if the number of enemies in that field is greater than the number of player characters in that field. That is the only reason you cannot move out of a field with enemies

Nothing in the app or the rules allows you to move tokens from one hero's play area to another.

[timing-cannot](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2941464/timing-cannot)

> Trickster's Merry Chase: before you sprint with this skill you may move an enemy 1 space.

> Quickbeam: You cannot sprint.

> Golden Rule: if a card ability uses the word "cannot" it is absolute and cannot be overridden by other abilities.

> When does the Sprint on Merry Chase (which was prepared in setup the same as Quickbeam mount) fizzle?

> Is it intended that the "before you sprint" is also part of the "cannot sprint"?

> Is the timing such that a player can do the "before you sprint" part of the card, then attempt to Sprint, but that is prevented by the "cannot"?

If you have Quickbeam equipped then you can never attempt to Sprint which means that “before you Sprint” effects can never be triggered. Pretend that the Sprint keyword isn’t even on the card.

> When a card combo like Merry Chase/Quickbeam is in effect at the start of the game, does that mean the player has to wait till he/she prepares a 5th skill (or have some other game effect cost a prepared skill) before he/she can discard it?

> If a player can do the "before you Sprint" and then try to sprint and it fizzles, May the player then discard that prepared card? (which otherwise would just sit there useless till I would gain a 5th prepared card or have to discard one.)

if a card has no other way listed on the card to discard it then you must wait until you have another game effect to discard it. This could be over-prepared or it could be another game effect such as a Damage/Fear card or a skill card like Master Tactician. However, it is not a very big deal given that Merry Chase has no symbols and it’s not like having it prepared stops the player from preparing other cards. It’s probably better to have it prepared since it means a player can’t draw it in tests, same reason players need to regularly prepare their Weakness cards.

[paths-unseen](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2732427/paths-unseen)

> Does the Paths Unseen card allow both the sprinter (user of the Paths Unseen card) and the "teleported" to not provoke attacks?

The person using the card is not being “placed.” They are moving normally so they will still provoke attacks. Since the person being teleported is being placed and not moving, you are correct that they won’t provoke attacks.

[trailblazer](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2713262/trailblazer)

> If I use this card as Sprint 1, do I get 1 inspiration due to the text above it "Before you sprint..." ?
> Or is it a choice between on or the other?

When the skill is prepared, the text is active, so gaining the inspiration applies to the same card too.

> Since range depends on spaces being adjacent only, are all shots allowed if a path can be traced regardless of how ridiculous the shot would be in reality?

Yes, all shots are allowed if a path can be traced.

[remove-from-adventure](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2491744/remove-from-adventure)

> When a card is removed from the adventure. Does the card come back in the next scenario of the campaign?

Officially, each "session" or chapter is called an adventure by the rules. The entire game is referred to as the "campaign."

Unless told otherwise, you will begin every single adventure with exactly one weakness (no more, no less), all the titles you've earned, and your role's #1 card (the one with stars around the name) prepared.

Another thing to track is corruption, this lasts from "adventure/scenario/episode...." to the next. The app tracks it and you add corruption tokens on each hero's card as a reminder since they could trigger Last Stands. 

One-time use per adventure. The general rule of thumb is that the campfire screen is your guide for what extra cards go into your deck. The idea is that players should not need to remember what was or was not bought/used in between sessions - the app remembers for them. Since Titles are always displayed at the campfire screen regardless of whether they were previously used or not, they will always go into your deck at the start of an adventure. In the rare case that a permanent effect occurs that is not displayed on the campfire screen (for instance losing some chapters can cause you to start with an extra weakness for the remainder of the campaign) the app will generally remind you of that permanent change at the start of every subsequent chapter.

> At the start of EVERY adventure you put in 1 weakness card (+ any others the game tells you to), and after each completion you take it out again
> What is the rule?

The end effect of the rule is that you start every chapter with exactly 1 Weakness. The reason it's written this way is because there are some in-game events (such as some specific enemy attacks) that can add a Weakness to your deck and that extra Weakness is not intended to persist past the chapter you're in. From a practical standpoint, there's no need to physically remove your Weakness and put it back between adventures. The important thing is that you're starting with the correct amount of Weaknesses (which 99% of the time will be 1.)

The are some exceptional cases when you will start a chapter with more than that however these are almost always the result of failing an important chapter, in which case the app will inform you that that's how it will be going forward and also remind you at the beginning of each future chapter. If the app isn't doing any of that, you only should have 1 Weakness.
